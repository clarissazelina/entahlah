A few months ago I picked up a muscle magazine at the gym and almost gagged out loud when I read a recipe for &#34;Protein Cupcakes&#34; that involved mixing protein powder and plain yogurt together and piping it on top of some. You can add to these Keto pancakes: chopped nuts, bacon bits, stevia sweetened chocolate chips, fresh blueberries, a dallop of whipped cream, monk fruit sweetened maple syrup, or my favorite- Keto Cinnamon Butter Recipe Simple, quick and easy to make.
