Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, sourdough challah. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

I&#39;ve been baking challah with active yeast for years but this is my first batch of sourdough challah. The sourdough adds a subtle tang to my challah, and the crumb has a moister, creamier texture that keeps even longer than the yeasted version. While it&#39;s true that challah or, for that matter, all bread was at one time sourdough (the Hebrew word for leaven, chametz, means &#34;sour&#34;), challahs have definitely gotten sweeter and richer since.

Sourdough Challah is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Sourdough Challah is something which I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look wonderful.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook sourdough challah using 12 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough Challah::

1. Prepare  For the starter:
1. Get 2 tablespoons (35 grams/1.2 ounces) very active, fully fermented firm sourdough starter, refreshed 8 to 12 hours earlier
1. Prepare 1/3 cup (80 grams/2.8 ounces) warm water
1. Prepare  About 1 cup (135 grams/4.8 ounces) bread flour
1. Prepare  For final dough:
1. Make ready 1/4 cup (60 grams/2 ounces) warm water
1. Make ready 3 large eggs, plus 1 for glazing
1. Make ready 1 1/2 teaspoons (8 grams/0.3 ounce) table salt
1. Prepare 1/4 cup (55 grams/1.9 ounces) vegetable oil
1. Make ready 3 tablespoons (65 grams/2.3 ounces) mild honey or a scant 1/3 cup (60 grams/2.1 ounces) granulated sugar

To make your sourdough challah, first prepare the starter, in a medium jar or container, combine ½ cup water with ½ cup whole-wheat flour and mix well. Finding a solid sourdough challah recipe has been on my bread baking list for awhile. While I have a sourdough enriched sandwich bread recipe that I love, the appeal of challah to me is that it&#39;s dairy free and the dough is easy to shape into beautiful braids — perfect for holiday celebrations! Leftover challah also makes excellent French toast, bread pudding, bostock…basically, I&#39;m.

Challah is a special Jewish bread that is traditionally eaten on Shabbat and Yamim Tovim (Jewish Holidays). Challah is one of my favorite traditional breads. A braided loaf of eggy white bread, sometimes topped with sesame or poppy seeds, as a result, it makes an appearance at most special meals. Sourdough challah seemed liked a good choice, but I wasn&#39;t sure where to start, so it sort of drifted to the back of my mind. Then, I discovered Jewlish by Jamie on Instagram and I thought…this is a sign.
