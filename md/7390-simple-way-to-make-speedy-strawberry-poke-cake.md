I will say though that I prefer to serve it a little closer to room temperature. Poke cake is a cake you poke holes into after baking. Then a liquid such as jello or fruit pur√©e is poured over the top to infuse added color and flavor to each bite. So now is the time to try this recipe! Using a fork, poke holes in the top and all the way through the cake.
