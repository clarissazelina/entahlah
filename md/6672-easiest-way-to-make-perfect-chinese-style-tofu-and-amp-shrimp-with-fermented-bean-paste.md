Serve with broccoli and rice for a fantastically delicious vegetarian meal. Every now and then I like to share some [â€¦] i love this recipe! i used to make mabo tofu from a mix but lately i&#39;m trying to make things from scratch to avoid the chemicals that come in processed foods. this was easy to make &amp; you know exactly what goes in it! i put in eggplant &amp; green peppers &amp; that really added to the dish. i used leftover ham instead of ground pork &amp; it turned out great. also used red chili sauce instead of the hot. Today&#39;s recipe is a Chinese-style vegan tofu curry! Even though it&#39;s Chinese-style, I should mention that it&#39;s not really a dish from China, but more of a Singapore/Malaysian Chinese dish. There are many types of tofu product on market from soft tofu to firm tofu, from tofu skin to dried tofu etc.
