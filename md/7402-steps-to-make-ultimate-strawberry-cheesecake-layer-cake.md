I decided to add a cheesecake layer to this poke cake. I still did a little of the traditional jello but used half of it in the creamy cheesecake layer. Strawberry Preserves The limited-edition cake starts with cheesecake-flavored ice cream, which is then layered with a layer of sweet graham cracker filling, and topped with strawberry ice cream. Spread the rest of plain glaze on the cheesecake layer.

Then place last second layer of cake on top of that. Frost edges of cake, pour sliced strawberry glaze mix on top of the cake, not spreading it to the edges, then with piping bag, pipe frosting around edges to contain strawberry topping. I also spread a thin layer of strawberry jam over the surface of the cake as well. Decorate the top of the cake with fresh strawberries. Serve immediately, using a very sharp knife to cut the cake, making sure you are cutting all the way through the crust.
