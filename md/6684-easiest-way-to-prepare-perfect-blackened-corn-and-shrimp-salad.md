recipeingredient:
- 2 ears sweet corn cut off the cob
- 2025 medium sized fresh or thawed shrimp deveined and peeled
- 2 T vegetable oil
- 2 large slicing tomatoes cut into bitesized pieces
- 2 shallots diced
- 1 jalapeo pepper diced
- 14 c fresh basil leaves diced
- 14 c mayonnaise more to taste
- 6 oz Cojita cheese crumbled more for garnish
-  Juice from 1 lime
- 1 T chili powder or to taste
- 12 T smoked paprika or to taste
- 3 green onions diced
- to taste Salt
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large iron skillet, heat vegetable oil over high heat until shimmering."
- "Add corn. Let sit without stirring for two minutes, until corn begins to char. Stir once and let sit for another two minutes."
- "Add shrimp. Continue to cook, stirring once every two minutes, until shrimp is cooked through, corn has blackened bits and is beginning to pop in the pan. You want a dry pan for the corn to blacken properly-- if the shrimp or corn release too much water during cooking, you can drain it off with a strainer and return the corn and shrimp to the skillet to continue charring. I find this is usually only a problem with frozen shrimp."

Add in the tomatoes, shallots, jalape単o, basil, mayonnaise, Cojita cheese, lime juice, chili powder and paprika. Taste and add salt, additional lime juice, chili powder, mayo or paprika as needed."
