These deviled eggs, courtesy of chefs Jeff McInnis and Janine Booth of Root &amp; Bone in New York City and Miami are truly a treat, with fantastic flavor and acidity coming from the pickled beets and great texture from crispy vegetable chips.

Add the butter, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, salt, and pepper to the food processor. Remove the blade from the food processor bowl and stir in the sweet relish.
