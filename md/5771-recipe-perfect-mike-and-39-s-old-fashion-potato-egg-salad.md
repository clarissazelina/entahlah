- "Wash potatoes well. Do not peel. Then boil potatoes until you can easily run a knife through the largest potato. Drain and allow them to cool slightly."
- "Whip milk, mayo and spices in a very large bowl. You&#39;ll want your texture thick enough to coat and stick but, thin enough to mix easily."
- "Peel eggs and quarter. Chop vegetables."
- "째 Chop your warm potatoes into bite sized 1&#34; pieces. Place potatoes into your chilled mayo mixture. Gently fold them in until they&#39;re fully coated. Your warm spuds will break up easily!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    째 It&#39;s important that your potatoes be warm upon mixing. They&#39;ll immediately begin to absorb your mayo/milk/spice mixture."
- "Gently incorporate your eggs and vegetables in with your potatoes. Again, fold in gently until everything is completely coated. If your mixture is too thick and not coating easily, just add a splash of whole milk and mix in your bowl. Repeat if necessary."
