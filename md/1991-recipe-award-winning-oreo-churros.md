In the bowl of a food processor, grind Oreo cookies until the texture resembles sand. In a small bowl, sift together flour, cocoa, salt and Oreo crumbs. In a small saucepan, combine water and butter. Bring to a simmer until butter is melted. I used a black cocoa powder which better imitates the color of Oreos, but you can also use a dark brown cocoa powder and your churro cookies will just be a little lighter in color.
