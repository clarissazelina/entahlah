recipeingredient:
- 46 Med to Large Russet potatoes or 810 Red potatoes Using russets in the pictures
- 4 Large Eggs or more if you like my family does so I use 6 at least
- 1 Med Sweet onion or 1 Bundle Green Onions Optional Using sweet onion for these pics
- 1 12 c Mayonnaise Maybe a little more or less to taste
- 13 c Sweet Relish
- 2 tbsp of each Spicy Honey Dijon and Reg Mustard
- 2 tbsp Creole Seasoning More or Less depending on how you like your spice level You can buy at the grocery store but I also have a homemade recipe for it as well on my page
- 14 c Bacon Bits or 23 slices of bacon fried and broken up
- 23 Roasted Garlic Cloves minced and chopped up Easy EASY recipe also available for Roasted Garlic on my page or Couple tbsp Minced garlic Garlic Salt or Powder will work too
- To Taste Salt and Pepper
recipeinstructions:
- "Get the potatoes in heavily salted water, begin to slowly boil, to be able to add eggs. Add eggs when boiling starts. Cover and let boil for another 10 - 15 min."
- "While the boiling is going on, prepare the onions and precooked garlic (if that&#39;s what your using, this is the garlic in the pic) Chop or dice both very finely."
- "This is the chopped onion."
- "Once the boiling is finished. Drain the water off of the potatoes and eggs. Cool down easiest way possible.... for me I drain the hot water off and add cold water, then refrigerate while getting other ingredients together. If I&#39;m in a hurry I do an ice bath, pull off the heat, drain, then add ice and cold, COLD water to it. Let it sit for a few min then begin the peeling process. This way the skins of the potatoes will peel straight off with your fingers, nothing else needed."
- "Once potatoes are peeled, dice LARGELY!! Peel eggs and dice LARGELY, as well. When you mix everything it will come together great, so go BIGGER on cutting up the POTATOES N EGGS!! That&#39;s kinda the great thing about this recipe your cuts don&#39;t have to be perfect!! Go ahead and add garlic and seasoning (salt, pepper, creole, ect.) and stir it up!!"
- "Last step!! Mix it all together!!! Add the mustard, mayo, relish!! The longer you can let it sit, and marinate, it makes it better. I usually make mine the night before and that&#39;s the way my family likes it!!"
