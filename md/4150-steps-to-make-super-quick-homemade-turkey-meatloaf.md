Turkey meatloaf, meatballs or burgers have been known to happen. I am a vegetarian wannabe who dabbles in turkey, and other fish and meat on occasion. For some time now I have added soy sauce to most ground turkey preparations in place of salt. Soy sauce adds flavor as well as moisture to ground turkey. I love your idea of adding the chili sauce.
