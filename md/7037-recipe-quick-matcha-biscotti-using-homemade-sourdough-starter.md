This recipe does not require any leavening so your sourdough starter does not need to be refreshed or active for this to work. Although I use freshly-milled flour you can certainly use store-bought whole wheat. Biscotti are twice baked, but be careful not to overdo it, as the biscotti can become extremely hard. Yes indeed, if it is the dramatic marbled matcha, turmeric and black sesame stunner which demands and commands its own exclusive space. This was my first successful sourdough starter!
