- "Add tomatoes once the onions are done. Close the IP with a glass lid and cook for another 2 minutes, make sure you stir in between.Add few tbsp water if the masala sticks to the bottom of the pot."
- "Add all the spices and stir well.Close the IP with glass lid and let it cook for 2 minutes until oil separates from the mixture.Make sure nothing burns or sticks to the bottom. Add few drops of water if needed."
