There will be times that call for a mud-cake like Fudge Cake made with both cocoa powder and melted chocolate. There will be times that call for intensely dark chocolate cakes. Chocolate flavour oozes all through this cake even though it&#39;s only made with cocoa powder, like our very own Fudgy Chocolate Cake. Whether you eat it plain, dust it with powdered sugar or serve with dollops of cream or scoops of ice cream, it truly is perfectly perfect! This chocolate cake is also made with oil, instead of butter.
