Hailing from Holland, Dutch cream spuds are perfect for frying or serving cold in a niçoise salad. Their creamy flavour means they are one of the few waxy varieties that work in a mash too — you might not even need to add butter or cream. This salad begins with red potatoes, which is a very good sign, and ends being tossed in a really nice dressing spiked with lemon juice. A pleasant taste change from the same old, same old potato salad. This easy potato salad is the best potato salad recipe ever!
