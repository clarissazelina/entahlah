recipeingredient:
-  Sourdough Predough
- 80 g whole wheat flour
- 40 g bread flour
- 120 g warm water
- 12 g sourdough starter
-  Main Dough
- 280 g allpurpose or bread flour
- 105 g water room temp
- 16 g unsalted butter
- 8 g salt
-  Lye Wash
- 1520 g lye I always use 20 g but depending on the baker it may be less
- 500 ml water
-  Toppings choose what you like
- 12 tsp Course rock salt or pretzel salt or as needed
- 12 tsp Caraway seeds or as needed
- 12 tsp Sesame seeds etc or as needed
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix sourdough pre-dough ingredients in a small bowl. Let stand for 20-24 hours at room temperature."
- "In a large bowl, mix the flour, butter and salt for the main dough. Put sourdough pre-dough on top and pour over water. Gradually mix in liquid with your fingers until hydrated and crumbly, but can be kneaded into a ball."
- "Form dough into a rough ball and remove from bowl to a floured surface for kneading. Knead until smooth about 10 minutes."
- "Return to bowl and cover. Let rest for 90 minutes."
- "Divide dough into 8 pieces. Form into rounds for pretzel rolls, or roll out into long pieces to form into twisted pretzel shapes. (I&#39;ll explain how to make the shapes below):"
- "For rolls, take a piece of the dough and gently pull up and fold the sides of the dough into the center of the ball, rotating as you go. You&#39;re trying to get the bottom part nice and round and smooth."
- "Turn over so the folds are on the bottom and place on the tray."
- "For the pretzel twists, first roll each piece of dough into short &#34;log&#34; shape by folding over the edges of the dough over itself 3-4 times. Gently press down at the edge of the fold each time you fold over, but be careful not to squash out all the air in the log."
- "The point is to get an evenly thick cylinder/log shape so you can roll them out nicely without getting a lopsided pretzel."
- "Next, using your fingers (not palms!), gradually  roll out the edges of each log into long pointy ends (see next photo). Leave the very middle intact as this part will be the plump part of the pretzel. If the the dough is slipping as you roll, spray a little bit of water on your working surface so the dough sticks just a tad bit without slipping."
- "Here is what it looks like when you&#39;re finished rolling out! It&#39;s about 4 times the length of the original log shape."
- "Now just twist the ends once or twice around each other like this."
- "Then flip the twist up and over, pressing the very tips into the dough at towards the top with your finger."
- "Arrange them on a tray with some space in between..."
- "Then cover lightly with a tea towel. Place in refrigerator for 9-12 hours. This lets it slowly rise giving it more flavor and lets the outside dry a little bit, making it easier to dunk in lye water or boil in the baking soda water."
- "After 8-12 hours and when you&#39;re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 210Â°C/410Â°F. Line your baking sheet with wax or parchment paper."
- "Prepare the Lye Wash: Put 500 ml of cold water into a medium bowl and then carefully put the lye into the water and gently stir to dissolve. The water will become cloudy at first, but then clear up again. (note: DO NOT use aluminum bowls because the lye will react with aluminum)."
- "Take the pretzels out of the fridge. Make sure you put on rubber gloves that will not let any lye liquid go through to your skin! One by one, dunk each pretzel into the lye water for 4-5 seconds making sure all surfaces are submerged in the water. Shake off excess liquid and move each pretzel to your lined baking sheet."
- "While still wet, sprinkle the pretzels with the salt and other toppings if using."
- "For the twisted pretzel, make a horizontal slit across the fat part of the pretzel."
- "For the pretzel rolls, cut a fairly deep X into the roll with scissors."
- "Bake for 18 minutes at 210Â°C/410Â°F. Remove from oven and let cool on a cooling rack for a few minutes. Enjoy with plenty of butter!!"

Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, sourdough lye pretzels. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sourdough Lye Pretzels is only one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look wonderful. Sourdough Lye Pretzels is something that I have loved my whole life.

Sourdough Pretzel CrispsÂ® Are A Modern Twist On An Old Favorite Snack. Further, the dough is rather easy to get together, mix, and bulk â€” the only slightly involved part of the process is the lye bath. Sourdough Lye Pretzels I&#39;ve been experimenting with sourdough pretzels over the past month, trying different proportions of sourdough to see how they turn out.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have sourdough lye pretzels using 17 ingredients and 22 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough Lye Pretzels::

1. Take  Sourdough Pre-dough:
1. Prepare 80 g whole wheat flour
1. Take 40 g bread flour
1. Make ready 120 g warm water
1. Prepare 12 g sourdough starter
1. Get  Main Dough:
1. Make ready 280 g all-purpose or bread flour
1. Get 105 g water (room temp)
1. Get 16 g unsalted butter
1. Make ready 8 g salt
1. Get  Lye Wash:
1. Make ready 15-20 g lye (I always use 20 g, but depending on the baker it may be less)
1. Take 500 ml water
1. Take  Toppings (choose what you like):
1. Prepare 1-2 tsp Course rock salt or pretzel salt, or as needed
1. Get 1-2 tsp Caraway seeds or as needed
1. Get 1-2 tsp Sesame seeds, etc, or as needed


Remove the pretzels from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired. The water bath will help with that! If you are putting baking soda in the water bath as noted in the directions, that is the key to them browning in the oven ðŸ™‚ Don&#39;t go overboard though with the baking soda because they will absorb the taste of the baking soda, just a little of it (as noted!) in the water bath will do the trick!

Hi, I was searching the net to find a place to buy lye for baking pretzels, when I found this site. Desperate to find some new way. These days pretzels are the most popular in Germany and the United States. What gives the pretzels their distinctive taste and texture is a combination of a low hydration dough and the lye bath that the pretzel is dipped in before being baked. A lye (sodium hydroxide) bath is what gives pretzels their unique flavor, hard crust, and rich brown coloring. 

So that is going to wrap this up with this exceptional food sourdough lye pretzels recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I'm confident you can make this at home. There's gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don't forget to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading.
