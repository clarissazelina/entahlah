The steam that is given off from the water helps the loaf get that nice crust that a good loaf of French bread needs. Combine the water, honey, salt and yeast in a glass bowl. Next, add a bunch of flour. Slowly add your dry ingredients, while mixing with your dough hook. You want to add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides.
