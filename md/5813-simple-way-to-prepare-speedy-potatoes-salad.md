A bit of crunch, a bit of citrus, and a kick of savory soy blend beautifully. In this recipe, the potato salad also gets a punch of yummy texture thanks to the mixture of ingredients. Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Cut the potatoes into chunks, then throw into a bowl with the shallots, capers and cornichons, if using. Potato salad is an American institution, and hardly seems difficult to throw together, but the right technique—and the right ingredients—make all the difference between creamy, fluffy potato salad (aka, the ultimate summer side dish) and gloppy, heavy, sad-making mush.
