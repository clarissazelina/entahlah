- "In a the other bowl, beat the egg whites until it forms stiff peaks like a meringue. Quickly beat in the rest of the sugar."
- "Gently fold in the egg yolk and almond mixture."
- "Put the rhubarb into the springform pan evenly accross the crust dough. Pour over the egg mixture and even off the surface. Push down the sides of the dough if it&#39;s too high up the pan."
- "Bake in the 190°C/375°F oven for 40 minutes. Remove, and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan before removing the springform."
