##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough Flat bread baked in the pan::

1. Get 50 gr feed sourdough starter (natural yeast)

Crack Open the Oven Door at the End. A sourdough that has been fed (as wehn mixed into a final bread dough) has only so much capacity to rise, as once the food goes there is no more gas to be produced. 

##### Instructions to make Sourdough Flat bread baked in the pan:

1. The day before, feed the sourdough starter (if it is in the fridge). You may skip this step if you don&#39;t have sourdough starter. You may substitute it with 1 tsp baking soda.
1. Mix the fed sourdough starter, flours, water, salt and oil in a bowl. If it is too sticky to handle, add 1-2 tbsp flour.
1. Knead the dough for 10 minutes until it is smooth.
1. Bring the ingredients into a ball shapes. Place it in a greased bowl and cover it up with towel. Keep it in warm place.

Most recipes allows for the dough to be mixed, then for there to be some proportion of the time before baking allowing an initial, partial rise (the &#34;bulk ferment&#34;). To create that steam, you&#39;ll need to preheat a metal rimmed baking pan under the baking sheet as well. Just after you transfer the dough (parchment paper and all) to the hot baking sheet, pour some hot water into the rimmed pan and shut the oven door as quickly as possible. Plain sourdough flatbread is great on its own but feel free to add additional herbs and spices for even more flavor. Slide the parchment directly onto the stone in the oven.
