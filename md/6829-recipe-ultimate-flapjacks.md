Hello everybody, it's me, Dave, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, flapjacks. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Flapjacks is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are nice and they look wonderful. Flapjacks is something which I've loved my whole life.

Use rich dark chocolate and light orange to make these fab flapjacks. Adding both the zest and the juice ensures a stronger, zingy flavour and a better consistency. Our chocolate orange flapjacks are a great weekend bake to enjoy with coffee at leisure.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook flapjacks using 10 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Flapjacks::

1. Make ready 175 grams butter
1. Make ready 175 grams demerara sugar
1. Prepare 100 grams golden syrup
1. Make ready 75 grams plain flour
1. Get 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1. Take 250 grams oats
1. Make ready 1 tbsp cinnamon powder

Flapjack lobster (Ibacus peronii), a crustacean that lives in shallow waters around Australia; Flapjack octopus (Opisthoteuthis californiana), a deep-sea mollusc; Flapjack (plant) (Kalanchoe tetraphylla), native. Flapjacks should be moist and stick-in-your-teeth gooey. These were extremely dry and as others have noted they easily broke apart. I think the cook time is too long in this recipe and also that there needs to be much more sugar/butter binder. 

##### Instructions to make Flapjacks:

1. Preheat fan oven to 170c
1. Line flat baking tray with parchment paper
1. Add the butter, sugar and syrup into a pan and heat until the sugar is melted

It is definitely not necessary to melt the butter/syrup/sugar in a pan before mixing in the oats. Not sure if this made a difference, but I pulsed the mixture a fair bit, until. Flapjacks are super simple to make and Lorraine Pascale&#39;s easy flapjack is a great place to start for beginners. If you want something out of the ordinary, try our chocolate, honey and coconut. Classic, chewy and good for your soul, Lorraine Pascale&#39;s flapjacks are simple to make and hard to beat!
