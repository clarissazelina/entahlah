recipeingredient:
- 1 medium onion minced
- 4 cloves garlic minced
- 1 carrot peeled and finely chopped
- 1 zucchini cored and finely chopped
- 2 celery sticks finely chopped
- 1 pinkysized nub ginger peeled and freshly grated
- 2 tsp Maggi seasoning
- 14 cup milk
- 5 slices plain white bread
- 34 lb lean ground beef
- 34 lb lean ground pork
- 1 large egg
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 34 cup ketchup
- 2 tbsp sweet chili sauce
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 4 tbsp brown sugar
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a good splash of olive oil into a large pan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and let cook for 1 minute until softened."
- "Add the veg to the pan along with the ginger, Maggi, a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Let cook until the veg starts to caramelize (about 5 minutes). Take the pan off the heat and let cool to room temperature. While waiting, preheat your oven to 375 F."
- "In a bowl, add the milk to 3 slices of bread. Use your hands to work them, tearing the slices apart as you go. You should end up with barely moist bits of bread."
- "Add the bread to a large mixing bowl along with the cooled veg, both meats, egg and soy sauce. Add a couple of grinds of black pepper, then knead everything together. Be careful not to overmix, or you&#39;ll end up with tough meat. You just want to combine the ingredients."
- "Lay the remaining 2 slices of bread at the bottom of a 6 x 8 loaf pan (they&#39;ll serve as sponges to soak up excess oil). Pour the meat mixture into the pan and gently spread it out until it&#39;s even. Push the meat into the pan slightly but fight the urge to really pack it down."
- "Add the ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar to a small pot on medium-low heat. Warm through while whisking until the sugar just melts. Use half of the sauce to glaze the top of the meat, then put the loaf in the oven. Let bake for 30 minutes."
- "Spread the remaining sauce on top of the loaf. Turn the heat up to 400 F and let bake for 15 minutes or until the internal temperature of the loaf reaches 155 F. Let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before serving. Don&#39;t forget to remove the 2 pieces of bread from the bottom."
