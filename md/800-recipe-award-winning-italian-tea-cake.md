Hey everyone, it's Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, italian tea cake. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

A ciambellone is a simple, sunny Italian tea cake with lemon zest and a rich crumb typically baked in a tube pan, which gives it a torus shape, i.e. the appearance of a doughnut, which is, in fact, what Google Translate tells me is the translation of ciambellone. As I can never resist the siren call of either an everyday cake or a doughnut, I am unequivocally here for this. Cool, remove seeds, and chop very fine.
