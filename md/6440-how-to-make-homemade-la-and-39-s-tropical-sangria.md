Hello everybody, it's Louise, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, l.a&#39;s tropical sangria. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sweet dessert wine teams up with peaches, strawberries, mango, and pineapple chunks for a light-colored sangria with a tropical taste. Make it the day before--it&#39;s great on a hot day. This is the sangria that my friends taught me to make in Spain.

Or teasing about it on instagram. I swear one of these days I will actually post a recipe the same day I make it. La Sueca es una sangría tinta. Garnacha por parte de madre y Tempranillo por parte de padre.

El resultado es un vino fresco y afrutado macerado con extractos naturales de zumo de naranja, limón, canela, melocotón, albaricoque, lima y otros frutos rojos durante varias semanas en depósitos de acero inoxidable, hasta que adquiere el toque suequil que buscamos. Aside from the basic bones of this recipe (the wine, oranges, lemons, limes and specified liqours), many variation work. This strain&#39;s buds are bright green with facets of purple throughout and emanate an aroma of pine. This sangria has a twist, however! The addition of blue curacao adds a brilliant, tropical blue that just screams &#34;summer vacay.&#34; One of my favorite summer hostess tips is keeping a bottle of blue curacao around to add a dash of &#34;tropical&#34; to lots of cocktails!
