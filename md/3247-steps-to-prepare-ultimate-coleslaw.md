Choose from our most-popular renditions for your next picnic or potluck. This coleslaw is a great side dish to bring to summer potlucks, and pairs well with recipes like Slow Cooker Pulled Pork, tacos (especially fish tacos), lunch wraps with deli meat, hot dogs, and more. I don&#39;t recommend it, as raw cabbage does not freeze well. This is a very good basic coleslaw dressing, not too goopy. Coleslaw has the best texture and flavor the day it&#39;s made, but it still keeps well for several days in the fridge.
