Compared to most other low-carb breads, I find that the moisture in this keto yeast bread is negligible. However, if you use ground sesame seeds instead of fine sesame flour, you will get a lot more moisture. The great news is that by choosing Keto Breads you can now enjoy all the delicious bread you want - without the harmful effects of grain. The most common reason why people fail to achieve success on the ketogenic diet - or any healthy diet for that matter - is that they are tempted by their favorite comfort foods. And that, my friends, is my list of favorite keto bread recipes.
