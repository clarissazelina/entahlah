This Italian restaurant is located on Ventura Boulevard and a few blocks away from the Sherman Oaks Galleria. When the Drago family was naming the Sherman Oaks restaurant, they wanted a title befitting their love of fresh Italian foods and an homage to their southern Italian heritage. The Tuscan bread salad called panzanella is the perfect place to use those sad, soft tomatoes that are still rich in flavor. Traditional panzanella is made with stale, dried bread that&#39;s rehydrated from a dressing of sweet tomato juices, vinegar and plenty of olive oil. 

##### Steps to make Panzanella:

1. Put a large nonstick pan on medium heat. Your garlic toast should already come pre-buttered, so just put it in the pan for a few minutes per side to toast it up. When they&#39;re crunchy and slightly scorched, remove them to cool.
1. Put the bell pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, capers, shallot, dill, basil and lemon and orange zest in a large mixing bowl.
1. Whisk together the garlic, vinegar, olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour the dressing into the bowl of veg. Cut the garlic toast into bite-sized pieces and add them as well. Toss everything together, then refrigerate 30 minutes to overnight. When serving, use a veggie peeler to top the salad with slivers of parmesan cheese.


Panzanella should feature toasted bread, mixed in at the last minute. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll try this version again. I always forget how amazing panzanella is, and then around this time every summer, I remember. This classic Italian salad seems somehow too simple — and too improbable — to be as good as it is. We&#39;re talking about a mix of day-old bread and juicy ripe tomatoes with whatever veggies might be in need of using, all tossed with a light vinaigrette.
