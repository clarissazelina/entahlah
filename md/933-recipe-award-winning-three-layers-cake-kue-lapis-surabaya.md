Unlike the Kueh Lapis Legit, where I have to be on my feet for three hours grilling each layer one by one, Kue Lapis Surabaya is much easier to make because its just three layers. The only drawback is that you&#39;ll need three cake tins to bake the layers concurrently. In Surabaya itself, the cake is known by the name of &#34;spiku&#34;.
