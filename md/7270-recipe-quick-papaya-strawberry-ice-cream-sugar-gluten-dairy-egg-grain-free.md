I have a Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker that works beautifully and won&#39;t break the bank. Making ice cream in a Vitamix or food processor certainly works, but the end product lacks that creamy, ice dreamy mouth feel of true ice cream. See great recipes for Egg-free and oil-free cupcakes too! This beautiful pink tinted ice cream is bursting with strawberry flavor and has a lovely balance of creaminess and sweetness without either being over-powering. It&#39;s made with coconut milk (or coconut cream) and is dairy-free, egg-free and paleo-friendly, but really, it&#39;s so delicious anybody would enjoy it with, or without dietary restrictions.
