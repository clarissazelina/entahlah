I love King Arthur Flours sourdough rye recipe, but it is for a bread machine, which I don&#39;t like. Mainly because of the shape of the finished loaf, so I mix and knead it in the bread machine, and after the first rise, I shape and bake in the oven. Scald milk, add the sugar, salt and oil. Stir until sugar dissolves, then let cool to lukewarm. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.
