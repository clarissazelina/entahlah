The best recipe for Japanese potato salad comes from Shirley Karasawa of the now-defunct blog, Lovely Lanvin (lucky for us, she&#39;s still very active on Instagram). The fashion-loving Japanese-American home cook, who splits her time between Seattle and Tokyo, has incredible taste in all things, but especially in food. Japanese versions of Western dishes, known as yōshoku cuisine, may look like the originals that inspired them, but the flavor is unmistakably Japanese. Take this potato salad, which derives its unique flavor from Japanese mayo, rice vinegar, and hot mustard. Japanese potato salad falls into the category of yōshoku: Japanized &#34;Western&#34; food.
