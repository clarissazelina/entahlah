An Orange Margarita is a Classic Margarita with FRUITLAB Orange Liqueur instead of Triple Sec - this reduces the sweetness and boosts the organic orange taste. To make our award-winning orange liqueur, we hand-zest hundreds of local oranges for an intense tang and bitter-sweetness. I adore your persimmon margaritas as well and am thinking that I&#39;ll rim my next glass of orange margarita with cinnamon and sugar instead of salt like you did with the Persimmon version. The salty or sweet taste complements the tang of the margarita&#39;s orange liqueur and the bite of the tequila. Steer clear of table (iodized) salt, which is much too salty for margaritas.
