This slow cooker pasta e fagioli starts with a pound of dried pinto beans (great northern beans work well too) and a flavorful broth.

We prefer pancetta â€” the salty, dry cured Italian ham, which gives the broth a rich savoriness. This slow cooker version is just like what you&#39;d get at your favorite Italian restaurant (not to mention cheaper)..
