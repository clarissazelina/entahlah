Shepherd&#39;s Pie recipes are traditionally done with lamb, but are great with any ground meat--turkey and beef being the most popular modern versions. Give this great casserole a try, and watch everyone flock to the table. Chose to use boxed butter and herb mashed potatoes because its quicker (could use homemade but be sure to also add milk) This is the best one ive tried yet. The sauce is really simple and flavorful, but the best part is the insanely fluffy mashed potato. Chicken pot pie may get most of the credit for being a savory twist on a classically sweet idea (fruit filling + buttery crust), but shepherd&#39;s pie — or cottage pie, as it&#39;s sometimes known.
