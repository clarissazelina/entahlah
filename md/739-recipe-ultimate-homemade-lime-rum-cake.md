I use coconut rum, and I don&#39;t notice a huge coconut flavor at all, it&#39;s just the rum I like to use. (And because I don&#39;t like a strong alcohol taste, I put the rum in the glaze for the last minute of cooking). Meanwhile, place the lime juice, Golden Caster Sugar and rum in a small saucepan and heat very gently until dissolved, then remove from heat. Lightly prick the top of the baked cake with a skewer. For the cake: Grease a Bundt pan and spread pecans on the bottom of the pan. Beat eggs, oil, water and rum in mixer just until incorporated.
