This is a great recipe for someone who is reserved about trying something new. Very tasty very easy and I got good results from the family members that tried it that refuse to try anything new..

Like lots of classic meatloaf recipes, this recipe calls for a ketchup-based glaze. While the ketchup flavor totally works here, it could be a little on the sweet side when paired with the brown sugar that gives it that beautiful glazed texture and appearance. If you thought you loved meatloaf before, you are going to go crazy for this smoked version. The smoke sort of acts like an extra ingredient, giving an incredible bonus aroma and flavor to the beef. And while a traditional meatloaf has a tomato glaze, it makes total sense to give this one a barbecue sauce twist.
