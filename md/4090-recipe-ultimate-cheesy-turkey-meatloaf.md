While I was still working I would put meatloaf in oven (frozen) with baker potatoes (wrapped in foil) and baked carrots in the morning before I left the house, and set up my delay bake cycle on my oven and come home to a nice meal. If you do have leftovers, you can cube the leftovers up and add to. Meatloaf is THE ultimate all American food.
