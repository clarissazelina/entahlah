This is a recipe for Cottage Pie. Thank you, Dale Shepherd&#39;s pie is traditionally made with a ground-lamb filling, but we make ours with ground beef.

Here in the states we are more of a beef eating culture than a lamb eating one, and when one is served &#34;shepherd&#39;s pie&#34; here, it is most often made with ground beef. Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb. There is nothing more comforting than layers of creamy mashed potato smothering delicious meat in gravy - our shepherd&#39;s pie selection includes traditional and veggie recipes.
