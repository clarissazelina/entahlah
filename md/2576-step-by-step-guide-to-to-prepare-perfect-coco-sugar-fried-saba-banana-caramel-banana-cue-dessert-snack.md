recipeingredient:
- 2 Saba Cardava bananas
- 12 Tbsp coconut sugar
- 34 Tbsp Cooking oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Saba or Cardava or Cooking bananas are the fat plump ones, greenish to yellow with blackish markings as it ripens. In Manila it is a popular street &amp; market food sold on sticks. I haven’t tried with plantains, not sure if we have those here or if its the same banana...try and let me know? :)"
- "Heat oil in pan. Prepare peeled bananas by slicing them or you can also cook whole like the traditional way in the Manila."
- "Roll all sides of the banana in the coco sugar and drop in hot oil. Use low heat to prevent burning."
- "When sugar melts turn it to the other side. Use a spatula or spoon to scoop back the sugar on to the banana if it separates. I turned them twice on each side before removing from the pan. Place on a plate and let it cool."
- "The coco sugar will harden and become crisp as it cools. Delicious. I placed too much I think (2 Tbsps) so 1 Tbsp should be ok for 2 bananas. :) Enjoy!"
