With the added goodness of oats, this classic farmhouse bread is a real taste treat. Even when freshly baked the buttermilk &#34;tang&#34; was not pronounced and lessened quickly over time; a couple days after baking it was just a too sweetish white bread. The both rises happen very quickly. In general, I try to make sourdough or whole grain bread for my family, but I must admit, there is just something about a nice soft slice of homemade white bread. And this is hands down the BEST recipe for white bread I have tried.
