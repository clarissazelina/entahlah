Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, cashew chicken fried rice. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Cashew Chicken Fried Rice is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Cashew Chicken Fried Rice is something that I have loved my whole life.

But Cashew Chicken is definitely, for me, a lifelong comfort food. I used to go to China Garden in my hometown, whether with my group of friends or my boyfriend (at the time) Kevin…and this is what I always ordered. After a few days struggling with getting everything moved over to WordPress, I&#39;m on my way to a nifty new self-hosted blog.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook cashew chicken fried rice using 9 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Cashew Chicken Fried Rice::

1. Get 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed
1. Take 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil
1. Prepare 2 medium onions, chopped
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp minced garlic (or more if you like)
1. Make ready 1 1/2 cup each of any 3 vegetables of your choice (I used Chinese cabbage, broccoli, red bell pepper)
1. Get 1/4 tsp ground black pepper (or to taste)
1. Make ready 2 cup cooled cooked white rice
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
1. Take 1 cup roasted cashews


Heat canola oil in a large nonstick skillet on medium-high. A saucy chicken stir fry with cashews, this is a terrific combination of flavours. You&#39;ll love how saucy this is, and how you can adapt this to your taste by using vegetables of choice. Try this with Hot and Sour Soup or Chinese Corn Soup with a side of Fried Rice for a homemade takeout experience! 

##### Steps to make Cashew Chicken Fried Rice:

1. Heat oil on medium-high,  sauté onions for 1 minute; add chicken, sauté until lightly browned.
1. Add all remaining vegetables and and cook until crisp.
1. Add rice, making sure any large clumps are broken up. Fry for 2 minutes.
1. Add soy sauce, mix through all ingredients well. Add cashews, and fry another minute.


Stir in cashews until coated in sauce. This dish of tender stir-fried chicken and roasted cashews in garlic sauce tastes just like take-out, only better. You don&#39;t need a wok — just a large nonstick skillet — and, aside from the chicken, the only chopping involves some garlic and scallions. Put simply, it all boils down to the age of the cooked rice … Freshly made rice = sticky, glue-like fried rice; Day-old rice = perfectly plumped, clump-free fried rice; The key element in this equation is the moisture level. Hot, fresh rice sticks together, while older, cooler rice is less likely to cling to itself.
