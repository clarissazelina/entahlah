Sourdough Bread This no-knead bread is no fuss to make and delicious, too, which I first learned when I was the cook at a remote fishing camp. It has a crisp crust and distinctive sourdough flavor from the &#34;starter&#34; yeast mixture you stir up in advance. Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour. Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knife, wielded firmly, works well here. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack.
