-  Rye Sourdough Predough
- 15 g rye sourdough starter
- 75 g rye flour
- 75 g warm water
-  Main Dough
- 150 g rye flour
- 100 g bread flour wheat
- 50 g spelt flour or use more bread flour
- 75 g salt
- 180 g warm water 4050C105122F
- 10 g honey or molasses
-  Optional
- 12 tsp caraway seeds
- 50 g sunflower seeds
- 1 medium sized Dutch oven pot with lid Staub Le creuset etc
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the ingredients for the sourdough pre-dough in a medium bowl. Cover and let the sourdough pre-dough set at room temperature for 20-22 hours. (alternatively use 160 g of active rye sourdough starter - 100% hydration)."
- "Mix the the flours, salt (and caraway/sunflower seeds) in a bowl."
- "In a separate bowl, mix the rye sourdough pre-dough with warm water and honey/molasses."
- "Mix the dry ingredients with the sourdough mixture until all ingredients are very well mixed, 5-10 minutes. You can use your hands or a wooden spoon, etc. The dough is sticky and like a paste, so you don&#39;t need to knead it like you would other breads."
- "After mixing :)"
- "You can keep the dough in the same bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let proof for 60-90 minutes at 24-25°C (75-77°F). If it&#39;s quite cold, then it will take around 3 hours."
- "Remove from bowl and place into a floured working space. Form into a round boule shape by folding over the edges of the dough into the center."
- "Dust the shaped dough with rye flour and place fold-side down into a flour dusted proofing basket (banneton). Let rise again for about 2 hours."
- "After rising, it will be significantly larger (about 1.5 times bigger)"
- "When nearing baking time, preheat oven to 250°C/480°F. Put a Dutch oven/Le creuset or other cast iron enameled pot into the oven while preheating."
- "When the dough is ready to go and your oven is preheated, remove the pot from the oven, then carefully remove the dough from the banneton and place it into the hot pot so that the round side is now facing up."
- "Bake for about 30-45 minutes (my oven is pretty weak so it takes 45 minutes. For the last 10-15 minutes, remove the lid of the pot so the crust can get a nice color."
- "Let cool for a few hours or up to half a day until slicing. this will let the flavors of the bread develop further."
- "It doesn&#39;t look much different, but here&#39;s the version I made with a nice schwarzbier/stout beer. It smells amazing, quite different the non-beer version."

If using whole wheat or rye flours or any other flours that have a lower protein content in them, try to blend the flours with a strong flour. This will help to balance out the protein content and will help with the development of a good strong gluten mesh. Overnight bread is a staple in my house and has been for years now. This version is a simplified recipe based off one of my most popular recipes, an overnight dark rye bread that&#39;s common here in northern Europe. Instead of including oats and cocoa powder to make it darker and denser, I&#39;ve kept the ingredients list very short - just whole spelt flour, rye flour, water, salt, and yeast.
