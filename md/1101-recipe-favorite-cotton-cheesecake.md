Cotton Cheesecake is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. Cotton Cheesecake is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.

Each Cotton Cheesecake is crafted in small batches. Our scratch made sauce is swirled in with style. Each graham cracker crumb crust is hand-formed.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook cotton cheesecake using 12 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Cotton Cheesecake::

Feathery, soft cotton cheesecake is a Japanese specialty, filled with lemon zest, fluffy egg whites, cream cheese, butter, and honey. My Cotton Cheesecake is perhaps not so jiggly as soufflé since I developed this recipe based on my old cookbook. But it&#39;s still soft and tastes great. There is a bit of science applied here to make a fluffy moist cheesecake: The meringue needs to have a soft peak. 

##### Steps to make Cotton Cheesecake:

1. Preheat the oven to 175C°. Grease and flour 8×8in baking pan. Heat the butter, cheese and milk over medium heat pan. Stir occasionally until it melt. Remove from heat.
1. In a large bowl, beat white eggs, sugar and cream of tartar until it becomes meringue. Meringue tips: try flip over your bowl on your face. If it do not fall on your face, it is meringue enough. Lol. Please do not intentionally mix it with other ingredient such as water or egg yolk or else your meringue won&#39;t come out perfectly. Clean and dry your bowl first before whisk them.
1. In another large bowl, beat egg yolk until thick and light.
1. Sift the cheese mixture and pour them into the egg yolk. Add flour and mix them into the mixture in batches.
1. Then, pour the white eggs mixture and lemon juice into the cheese mixture. Fold them until it well combined.
1. Pour the batter in a baking pan and bake for 60-70 minutes by using waterbath technique as the picture shown below
1. Remove the pan from the oven. Let it cool down and your super fluffy cheesecake is ready to serve!!


Do not beat the meringue too much and form a hard peak. The cheesecake turn out not cooked at all. I transfer the cheesecake back to oven and bake again. I doubt on the method with so low temperature water bath method. Japanese cheesecake is very different from regular cheesecake.
