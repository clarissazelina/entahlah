Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb. In a large bowl, mash potatoes with sour cream. Add salt and pepper; set aside.

1. Pie Meat: Add butter and oil to a large skillet on medium heat. Saute onions until tender about 10 min.
