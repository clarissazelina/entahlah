Since then I have made so many things using bananas, however, I have to say what I am calling The BEST Chocolate Banana Bread is insanely good (and moist) and tops the list of all things banana in my world (and right behind that are Banana Fritters with Caramel Sauce…OMG!!). This recipe seriously feels like you&#39;re eating actual chocolate cake… yet it&#39;s secretly good for you at the same time!. To cut back on calories without sacrificing taste or texture, I&#39;ve packed a full two cups of mashed banana into this decadently rich and dark chocolate banana bread. The moisture and sweetness from the extra banana makes the recipe so. The BEST Chocolate Banana Bread I&#39;ve ever had!
