Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, pina colada. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Pina colada is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions every day. They're fine and they look fantastic. Pina colada is something that I've loved my entire life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have pina colada using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pina colada::

1. Take 1 cup pineapple (chunks)

1. Make ready 1/2 cup pineapple juice
1. Make ready 1/2 cup milk
1. Get 4 Tbs dry coconuts

BLENDER Pina Colada (Frozen Pina Colada) - all ingredients are blended with ice in a blender, resulting in a slushie/smoothie (thicker) consistency. To make the blended drink you&#39;ll need a blender or a good immersion (hand) blender, that is able to crush ice. This is the original version of the drink. The pi√±a colada (/ Àå p iÀê n j …ô k o ä Àà l …ëÀê d …ô,-n …ô-,-k …ô-/; Spanish: pi√±a, &#34;pineapple&#34;, and colada, &#34;strained&#34;) is a sweet cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut or coconut milk, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice.

It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both. There are two versions of the drink, but both are. Pina colada literally means &#34;strained pineapple&#34;(Bet you a dollar that&#39;s a Jeopardy question someday!). The pineapple, coconut and rum flavors were all typical of the Puerto Rican style. Some say the pina colada got its start even earlier; a famous Puerto Rican pirate was known to give his crew a drink of pineapple, coconut and white rum.
