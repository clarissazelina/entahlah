Sourdough Bread This no-knead bread is no fuss to make and delicious, too, which I first learned when I was the cook at a remote fishing camp. It has a crisp crust and distinctive sourdough flavor from the &#34;starter&#34; yeast mixture you stir up in advance. Add milk and softened butter or margarine. Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour. Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knife, wielded firmly, works well here.
