Comes out looking and tasting better than any artisan bought bread out there! What&#39;s more, the dough takes just five minutes to make, does not require kneading or any special equipment, and can rest in the fridge for up to two weeks (the flavor becomes more complex the longer it sits). This is the basic &#39;Boule&#39; bread mix from the book Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day by Jeff Hertzberg and Zoe Francois. I&#39;ve mainly posted this recipe so that I don&#39;t have to hook out the book every time.

It&#39;s a very short list of ingredients to make this perfect loaf of homemade artisan bread. All-purpose flour, sea salt, yeast and sugar are the only ingredients you need. I use Sherpa Pink Himalayan Salt in my kitchen. All you need is: FLOUR: Bread flour results in a softer, fluffier bread because of the higher protein content. Regular all purpose or plain flour also work really well, with the texture changing only a little.
