Shepherd&#39;s Pie comes to us from England, and is traditionally made with lamb or mutton. Here in the states we are more of a beef eating culture than a lamb eating one, and when one is served &#34;shepherd&#39;s pie&#34; here, it is most often made with ground beef. Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb.
