Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, ginger soy salmon. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Ginger soy salmon is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. Ginger soy salmon is something which I have loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

We garnished our Soy Ginger Salmon with spring onions and sesame seeds, but if you are particularly pressed for time or ingredients, it tastes lovely without them too. For a complete meal, try this Soy Ginger Salmon with rice (this brown rice is my go-to) and simply steamed or saut√©ed veggies. Salmon is marinated overnight in soy sauce, brown sugar, orange juice, spices, and fresh ginger; then broiled to perfection!


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have ginger soy salmon using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Ginger soy salmon::

1. Make ready 2 salmon fillets
1. Get 2 tsp avocado oil
1. Take 2 tbsp soy sauce
1. Make ready 1 1/2 tbsp grated ginger (the pre done jars are great)
1. Take 2 tsp maple syrup (optional)


Add salmon fillets and turn to evenly coat. Combine ginger, garlic, lemongrass, cilantro, brown sugar, soy sauce, sake, vinegar, chili sauce and sesame oil. Add oil to a nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Add marinated fish and cook until crisp and golden on each side and cooked through. 

##### Steps to make Ginger soy salmon:

1. Lay the salmon fillets in the pan and put one tsp of avocado oil on each of the fillets. Rub very gently to spread it over the whole fillet as best as you can.
1. Mix the soy sauce, ginger and maple syrup together until ginger looks broken up and take a small spoonful at a time and coat the salmon.

In a medium pan, heat oil. Add salmon to the pan, but discard the used marinade. Pour in remaining marinade and reduce. This baked salmon recipe comes from my very popular ginger garlic baked chicken. I have been making the chicken for years but never thought of using the same marinade for salmon.
