Instead, my recipe is a riff on Osaka or Kansai-style okonomiyaki. We made our own sauces--one mayo-based with wasabi and teriyaki and the other a thai peanut sauce.

With stronger flavored veg and the traditional okonomiyaki flour maybe sauces would be more optional. Take your time cooking it - it&#39;s thick and you don&#39;t want raw mixture in the middle. When golden brown on the bottom, carefully flip and cook the other side until golden too. There are plenty of ways to make this savory Japanese pancake. In fact, the words okonomi and yaki roughly translate to &#34;what you like to cook.&#34; We like to cook ours with pork and top it with a tangy-sweet sauce.
