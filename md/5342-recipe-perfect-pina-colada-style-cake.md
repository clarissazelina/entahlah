recipeingredient:
- 360 ml Coconut sweetened
- 360 ml Allpurpose flour
- 12 tsp Baking powder
- 14 tsp Baking soda
- 115 grams Unsalted butter
- 160 ml Granulated sugar
- 12 tsp Salt
- 3 Eggs
- 12 tsp Rum essence
- 12 tsp Coconut essence
- 240 ml Sour cream
- 7 rings Pineapple canned
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180℃. Spread the coconut on a baking tray, and warm in the oven until slightly browned. This takes 6-8 minutes. Mix 2 or 3 times while warming. Then, leave to cool."
- "Squeeze the moisture out of the pineapple with a paper towel, and cut roughly into 5 mm-wide pieces. Coat the mould with butter, and sprinkle with flour (not listed). Combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda, and sift twice."
- "Put the butter, granulated sugar and salt into a bowl, and mix with a hand mixer at high speed until the butter whitens and turns fluffy. Then, add the egg in small batches, mixing well with each addition."
- "When the egg has mixed in, stir in the rum and coconut essence. Add the flour and sour cream alternately. Add 1/3 of the flour, then 1/2 of the sour cream, and mix with the hand mixer at low speed. Repeat, and then finally add the remaining flour."
- "Don&#39;t knead the flour once you&#39;ve added it all! Just give it a quick mix."
- "Use a silicone spatula to mix the cut pineapple and 240 ml of toasted coconut to the mixture from Step 4."
- "Pour it into the mould you prepared in Step 2, and gently smooth the surface. Top with the rest of the coconut (120 ml), and gently press on it with your hand."
- "Bake it for 65-70 minutes in the preheated oven. It&#39;s done when a skewer poked through the middle comes out clean. It burns easily, so it might be an idea to cover with foil after around 30 minutes."
- "When baked, leave it to cool in the mould for 15 minutes. Then, remove it from the mould, put it on a cooling rack and let it cool down to room temperature."
