Hello everybody, it's Drew, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, japanese potato salad. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

The classic Japanese potato salad is made of mashed potato (leaving some chunks behind), sliced cucumbers and carrots, eggs and sometimes hams. The ingredients are not too different from the western version, but flavoring wise, the Japanese version is always seasoned with Japanese mayonnaise and sometimes rice vinegar. Japanese versions of Western dishes, known as yōshoku cuisine, may look like the originals that inspired them, but the flavor is unmistakably Japanese.

Recipe Pin It While Japan may be famous for sushi, home cooking draws from a broad palette of global flavors. The best recipe for Japanese potato salad comes from Shirley Karasawa of the now-defunct blog, Lovely Lanvin (lucky for us, she&#39;s still very active on Instagram). The fashion-loving Japanese-American home cook, who splits her time between Seattle and Tokyo, has incredible taste in all things, but especially in food. Japanese potato salad falls into the category of yōshoku: Japanized &#34;Western&#34; food. Just as we Americans &#34;Americanize&#34; Japanese food by adding such things as cream cheese and avocado to sushi, for example, Japanese chefs have taken certain European and American dishes and tweaked them to suit their own palates.
