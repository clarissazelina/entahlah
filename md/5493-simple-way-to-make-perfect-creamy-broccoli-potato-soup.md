Cheesy Broccoli Potato Soup This seriously satisfying soup is brimming with hearty potatoes, nutritious broccoli and carrots and it&#39;s all embodied by a rich and creamy, deliciously cheesy broth. Pour in the broth and bring to a simmer. The creamy factor to the broth is thanks to potatoes cooked in the broth that have then seen the bottom side of my immersion blender before the broccoli goes in. Place lid on blender but REMOVE the feeding hole lid. Fold a tea towel and cover the hole, then use your hand to hold the tea towel in place.
