However, this Beetroot, Coconut and Ginger soup has such a beautiful, velvety flavour that has been enough for her to accept it in its cooked form. The star ingredient however is beetroot, giving the soup it&#39;s characteristic vivid colour. It is a versatile recipe which appeals to vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters alike.
