recipeingredient:
- 34 pound tritip cut into 2inch wide strips
-  For the marinade
- 1 cup lite or low sodium soy sauce
- 12 cup sugar
- 3 Tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 Tablespoons water
- 23 Tablespoons minced garlic to taste
- 2 green onions chopped
- 12 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 Tablespoon distilled white vinegar or 14 cup apple sauce as a tenderizer
- 1 Tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 Tablespoon neutral oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients in a bowl and stir or whisk until sugar is dissolved. Some soy sauces are saltier than others. If your marinade&#39;s too salty, try adding 1 teaspoonful of water at a time to dilute the saltiness to taste. Keep in mind as you&#39;re tasting, though, that the juices from the meat will also dilute the flavors."
- "Let the meat marinate for at least 1 hour. 3 to 6 hours or so ideally. 90 minutes before you&#39;re going to grill it, take it out of the fridge to bring the meat up to room temp. Meat almost always cooks better at room temp. (I mean, unless it&#39;s a crazy hot or crazy cold day, of course...)"
- "Grill over a pre-heated medium grill for about 3 minutes per side for something medium rare-ish. (And on these really chunky strips, when I say side, I mean all four of them.)"
- "Let the meat rest for 7 to 10 minutes before slicing."
- "Enjoy!"
