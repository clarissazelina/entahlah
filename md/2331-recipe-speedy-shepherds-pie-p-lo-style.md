Making the stuffing mix everything from the meat with spices and onion. A really good Shepherd&#39;s Pie should always start with a soffrito - that is, onion, garlic, carrots and celery saut√©ed on a lowish heat until sweet. It&#39;s the secret to a great flavour base that&#39;s a technique used widely by many cuisines, such as Italian cooking (for example, this Italian Shredded Beef Ragu). After this, we cook the ground / mince meat. Shepherd&#39;s pie is traditionally made with a ground-lamb filling, but we make ours with ground beef.
