Beside using the special gold-colored flour, add lots of sesame seeds with an egg-wash to the top, and most important - add some ice cubes to a preheated cast iron skillet on the bottom shelf of the oven for a crusty crust. I used sesame seeds on top this time (and in the bread) and would do add them to the top again but with the pumpkin seeds in the bread. I&#39;ve also made the keto bread (rolls) a couple of times. I also added a grated a garlic clove, dash of cayenne and Trader Joe&#39;s onion salt to the cream cheese, will add even more next time.

These easy sesame bread rolls are so light and soft, I also use them for sandwiches (hello holiday leftovers) serve with soups, stews and they even make the best burger buns. If you want to get really festive, a few years ago I made a rosemary bread wreath (&lt; click on text for link) that can also be a fun and edible table decoration. The sesame definitely gives the bread a wonderful nutty flavor. The honey adds a nice slight sweetness to the bread. I think the bread could have been baked a little longer as the bread was a little doughy towards the center.
