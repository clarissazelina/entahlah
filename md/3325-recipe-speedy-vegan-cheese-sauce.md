recipeingredient:
- 1 12 cups raw cashews soaked overnight
- 14 cup nutritional yeast
- 34 cup water
-  juice of one Meyer lemon I have Meyer lemons in my yard and they are a bit less acidic so if you use a regular lemon start with half a lemon and build from there to taste
- 14 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 12 tsp salt or more to taste
- 14 teaspoon garlic powder
-  Vitamix or other high powered blender is the best
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak your cashews overnight in the fridge in clean, filtered water"
- "Drain your cashews and then throw them into a high-powered blender like a Vitamix. add the water and then pulse a bit to break up the cashews and start getting them creamy."
- "Add all of your other ingredients and then blend until super creamy. Makes about 2 cups. Pour into a mason jar and it lasts for about a week in the fridge but it tastes so good it will not last that long. You serve it warm- I like to put it on the stove top or even microwave it for quick chips and cheese."
