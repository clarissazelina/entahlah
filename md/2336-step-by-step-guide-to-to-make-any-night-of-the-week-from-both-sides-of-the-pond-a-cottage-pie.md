Cottage pie is the name commonly given to a beef pie of the same variety. Cottage pie hails from the time when potatoes were first being planted in rural areas of the British Isles. Historically, the casserole was made with leftover meat, so we&#39;ve used that inspiration to create our chicken cottage pie recipe. A s for fish pie, cottage, shepherd&#39;s or any other midweek favourite crowned with mash, they&#39;re not allowed near the British Pie Awards either. &#34;Potato-topped pies aren&#39;t pies,&#34; says O. Make sure the pie is completely cold, then cover it well with cling film and freeze.
