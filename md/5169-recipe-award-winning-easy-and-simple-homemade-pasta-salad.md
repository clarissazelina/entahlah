recipeingredient:
- 12 cup mayonnaise I used Kraft mayonnaise with olive oil
- 14 cup to 12 cup Ranch dressing depending on your taste I used Wishbone
- 1 cup to 1 12 cups bow tie pasta
- 14 cup finely shredded carrot
-  salt
-  lemon pepper seasoning
-  Fresh lime juice
- 2 piece chicken breasts I had small but if you use a large one 1 should be fine
-  Bacon pieces
- 1 cup corn
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a pot of water to boil. Add salt to water to taste. Once boiling add chicken breasts. Boil until cooked through."
- "When cooked thoroughly remove from water and let sit for 5-10 to cool. To the same water add the pasta, asking more water if needed.  You do not need to add more salt because the water is already salted."
- "While pasta is cooking cut or shred chicken to desired size. Squeeze the fresh lime juice onto the chicken, making sure to combine it well, while it&#39;s still warm so that it may soak up the flavor."
- "After cutting the chicken, grate the carrot in a bowl and add the mayonnaise and ranch dressing letting it sit for a couple of minutes."
- "When pasta is just tender remove from the water, do not drain it. After removing from water, run it under cold water to stop the cooking process. Let it sit in the strainer and shake to run off excess water."
- "If you are using frozen corn, as I did, add it tonthe water that you cooked the chicken and pasta in. Cook until heated through usually about 3 min. If you are using can corn you can skip this step."
- "While the corn is heating up, add the drained pasta to the mayonnaise mixture along with the chicken and lemon pepper. When the corn is done, either run it under cold water as to cool it down, or add to the pasta mixture as is."
- "Mix all of the ingredients until combined well. Then lastly add in the bacon pieces and mix well. You can eat as in or place in the fridge to serve cold."
