Overcooked coffee cake is much worse than underdone coffee cake. If it is underdone, you can always put it back in. Eat the coffee cake with friends, family, share a pan with a neighbor, or eat the entire thing by itself straight out of the oven. And yes the cake rose and then sank almost immediately once it was out of the oven. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake ring.
