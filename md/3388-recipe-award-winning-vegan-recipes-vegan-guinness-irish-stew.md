I used a blend of red cooking wine and acv instead of the Guinness. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium to medium-high heat and add celery, onions and mushrooms. Add flour to vegetables, stir to coat and let cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the pot begins to brown. Irish stew is one of the quintessential Irish foods.
