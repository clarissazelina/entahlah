Hello everybody, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, pina colada ice-cream. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Pina Colada Ice-Cream is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions daily. They are nice and they look fantastic. Pina Colada Ice-Cream is something which I have loved my whole life.

Piña Colada Ice Cream came to me when I saw a coconut ice cream made from coconut milk for vegan frozen treat lovers. It got the wheels turning, but I knew I had to make it a little different. And while that version sounds delicious and I have complete respect for those who love coconut milk-based dairy products, I am partial to heavy cream.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have pina colada ice-cream using 5 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pina Colada Ice-Cream::

1. Take 1 cup coconut cream
1. Take 1/2 cup condensed milk
1. Take 200 ml cream, (olpers)
1. Prepare 2 tbls desiccated coconut
1. Get 1 tin or 1 cup with syrup Pineapple


Gradually add ice, processing until mixture is smooth and thickened. Pour into stemmed glasses and sprinkle with additional coconut. When ready to whip, turn right-side-up and open. Combine pineapple, condensed milk, cream of coconut, flaked coconut, and rum flavoring in a large bowl. 

##### Steps to make Pina Colada Ice-Cream:

1. Place all the Ingredients in the freezer for a while ler them chill. Blend pineapple and coconut cream together.

Pour into an ice cream maker. Pour in enough milk to reach the freezer line of the ice cream maker. Flushed with the success of an earlier creation, the no-churn margarita ice cream, I bring you the no-churn piña colada ice cream. Rich coconut, sharp pineapple, smooth cream: we are in business!
