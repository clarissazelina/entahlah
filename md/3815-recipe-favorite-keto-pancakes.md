This American classic is the perfect low-carb breakfast for lazy weekend mornings or even a weekday treat or dessert. Plenty of eggs and cream keep these pancakes fluffy, while almond and coconut flours keep the carb content low if you&#39;re on the keto diet. Pancakes are a staple keto breakfast recipe of American cuisine, but when you&#39;re on the keto diet, making fluffy pancakes is not always possible. This is mainly because keto friendly flours are gluten free and quite heavy and do not work in the same way that wheat flour works. Therefore, many keto pancake recipes may actually end up really dry.
