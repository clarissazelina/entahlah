recipeingredient:
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 14 teaspoon kosher salt
- 12 cup butter room temperature
- 34 cup light brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 3 large very ripe bananas dont mash until ready to mix
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 13 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 12 cup chopped walnuts
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° &amp; spray a glass 9×5 loaf pan with non stick spray."
- "In a large bowl sift together all the dry ingredients except walnuts (flour, salt, baking powder, and cocoa.) I sifted mine 3 times. This will ensure all your ingredients mix well and you won&#39;t overwork the batter."
- "In a separate bowl use a hand mixer to blend all the wet ingredients until smooth (eggs, butter, vanilla, and brown sugar.) Set aside and mash your bananas with a fork (a few chunks are ok.) Once mashed combine bananas with the wet ingredients. Add the walnuts and give a quick stir."
- "Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet. I recommend doing this in batches. I did 4 batches, gently folding each with a spatula. Stir just enough to combine. You don&#39;t want to overwork the batter because it will result in a dense bread. Pour into prepared dish and place on center rack in oven."
- "Bake at 350° for about an hour. Check for doneness by inserting a small knife or a wooden skewer into the center. It&#39;s done if it comes out clean. Ovens vary so cooking time may be a little different."
- "Remove from oven and let cool in pan for 30 minutes. After that remove from pan and cool for another hour on a rack."

Over the years, I&#39;ve made a black and white banana loaf, bananas foster banana bread, peanut butter-chocolate chip banana bread, zucchini-banana bread, ultimate banana bread, and yet, I still can&#39;t pass up a banana bread recipe when I see one. It&#39;s the same weakness I have for chocolate chip cookie or brownie recipes. No one can resist a thick slice of freshly baked banana bread, especially when it&#39;s studded with melting chocolate chips and toasty walnuts. Baking this bread is a good way to take advantage of fruit that has been languishing on the counter throughout the busy week. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and more delicious the bread will be.
