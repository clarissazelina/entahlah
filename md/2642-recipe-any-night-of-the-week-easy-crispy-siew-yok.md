recipeingredient:
-  Cheapest pack of salt
-  Slab of pork belly
- 34 tbsp 5 spice powder
recipeinstructions:
- "Rub the 5spice powder all over. Pack on the cheap salt on the skin till about 1-1.5cm high. That&#39;s why u need cheap salt. Expensive salt don&#39;t stick to themselves."
- "Bake at 200deg for 30mins. Use a xuetizi (those circular top down oven) as the skin crispy-fy more later. Fan forced oven is a heat and miss depending on your brand and oven heat."
- "Remove the salt crust. It will come off easily as one whole piece."
- "Bake again on top rack at 200deg for 30-40min till skin is blistered. My fan forced oven is uneven, so u can see the uneven blistering. I was too lazy to take out the xuetizi."
- "Take a spoon or fork and knock on the skin. You can hear the crispiness immediately~~ yum. Crispiness remains even after it was left out for a while (if u use a xuetizi). I moved mine out and blasted it hahaha"
- "Note: some ppl think poking the skin with a fork helps. It&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t see much difference. But u really have to slather on the salt esp the corners. Else they won&#39;t dehydrate in the first part and blister up later"

Home-made Siew yoke is actually quite easy thanks to the oven doing the bulk of the work. Most of the preparation time is actually just preparing it for the roast. Home-make Siew yoke is so much superior to those bought because of the super crispy and crackling skin. Hubby gives his thumbs up for this creation and his friends Michael and Thai. As far back as I can remember, crackly Roast Pork (Siew Yoke) was only served during festivals and special occasions like weddings, milestone birthdays, and baby&#39;s full moon (celebration of baby&#39;s first month of life).
