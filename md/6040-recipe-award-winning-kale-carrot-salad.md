We love a good kale salad and our Kale Quinoa Salad with Blueberries, Green Beans, Feta &amp; Pecans has been on the site from our inception. It is so good, in fact, that I served it at my all low FODMAP wedding! (Not one guest knew; the food was fabulous). Toss kale, carrots, avocado, red onion, pomegranate kernels, apple, and chicken breast in pomegranate vinaigrette as desired. Let chill in the fridge overnight to let the kale soften from the acid in the dressing.

Kale, roasted corn, and carrots are tossed with eggs, tortilla chips, and smoked cheese in a lemon vinaigrette in the best kale salad ever. By Alli Shircliff ADVERTISEMENT Emerald-green lacinato kale is the star of this healthy kale salad, tossed with an easy maple, mustard and apple cider vinaigrette and studded with crisp apples. The sturdy kale leaves won&#39;t wilt from the dressing and will taste even better after they&#39;ve been marinated in it.
