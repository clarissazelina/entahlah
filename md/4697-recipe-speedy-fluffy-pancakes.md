In my experience this negates the effect of souring the milk and the pancakes end up flat. Top these fluffy pancakes with fresh fruit, your favorite flavor preserves or syrup. Stack cooled pancakes between sheets of waxed paper or cooking parchment paper. To reheat, unwrap pancakes, and remove waxed paper. Easy, American-style, fluffy pancakes are great for feeding a crowd at breakfast or brunch.
