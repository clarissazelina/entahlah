You can use lean ground beef or turkey instead. Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb. That being said, I love me a good &#34;cheat&#34; meal like this Easy Shepherd&#39;s Pie. Add a side salad and you&#39;re good to go!
