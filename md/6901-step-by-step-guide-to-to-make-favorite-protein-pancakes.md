Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, protein pancakes. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Protein Pancakes is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. Protein Pancakes is something that I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Pancakes are probably one of the easiest breakfast recipes you can make, but they&#39;re usually carb-heavy and don&#39;t provide a ton of protein for a satisfying and filling morning meal (sorry, just. The protein powder I use is Vanilla Premiere Protein Powder. I have also heard that Quest protein powder works really well.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have protein pancakes using 8 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Protein Pancakes::

1. Prepare 1 cup Oatmeal (Quaker Old Fashioned)
1. Make ready 1/4 tsp Baking Soda
1. Make ready 1/2 cup Whey Protein Powder (Vanilla)
1. Take 1/2 cup Almond Milk
1. Prepare 2 Egg Whites
1. Take 1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract
1. Take 1/2 cup Sugar-Free Maple Syrup
1. Take 1/2 Banana


I have tried versions of banana protein pancakes using protein powder in the past but they tend to be dense and unappealing. One day a light went off in my headâ€¦whipped egg whites! By beating the egg whites alone, like you would for a meringue, it would make the batter much lighter and airier. Chewy and filling, these little healthy protein pancakes are perfect for a post-workout meal when your priority is protein, stat. 

##### Steps to make Protein Pancakes:

1. Place oats in a blender until finely mixed into a powder substance
1. Pour &amp; mix all dry ingredients into a small bowl
1. Add &amp; mix egg whites &amp; almond milk to the dry mixture
1. Set oven top to medium heat with a lightly greased skillet/pan
1. Pour mixture onto heated skillet/pan &amp; flip as you would like a regular pancake
1. Serve finished pancakes with sliced bananas &amp; syrup


These also are a good source of complex carbs thanks to the oats. If you&#39;re not doing grains, try something like almond meal or coconut flour, but keep in mind that cooking time may vary and you may need to add some liquid (like milk) to make it work.
