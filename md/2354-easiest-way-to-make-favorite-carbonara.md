Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, carbonara. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Humble ingredients—eggs, noodles, cheese, and pork—combine to create glossy, glorious pasta carbonara. It&#39;s the no-food-in-the-house dinner of our dreams. Pasta, eggs, cheese, and bacon come together in the ultimate Italian favorite: spaghetti carbonara.

Carbonara is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look wonderful. Carbonara is something that I've loved my whole life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook carbonara using 8 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Carbonara::

1. Make ready 1 box Pasta (bucatini is my favorite)
1. Take 3/4 lb Bacon, diced
1. Make ready 1 tbsp Oil
1. Prepare 1/4 cup Onion, sliced
1. Take 1/4 cup Mushrooms, thick sliced
1. Get 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
1. Prepare 2 Eggs, beaten
1. Take  Black pepper


This [recipe] comes right from Italy. We use only guanciale, eggs, pecorino cheese, and lots of black pepper (carbonaro is the Italian for coal miner). This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll that has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized and turned into an Italian tradition that, like many inviolate Italian traditions, is actually far less old than the Mayflower Because America may have contributed to its creation, carbonara is Exhibit A in the back-and-forth between Italy and the United States when it comes to food Remember: the. I can&#39;t eat, think about, dream about, or even remotely consider Pasta Carbonara without thinking of Heartburn, the Meryl Streep/Jack Nicholson movie from the eighties that I both love and hate. 

##### Steps to make Carbonara:

1. Brown bacon to half-crispy.
1. Boil noodles to taste.
1. Add mushrooms and onions. Add extra oil if needed. Sauté until onions and mushrooms are browned.
1. Beat eggs, Parmesan cheese and black pepper in a separate bowl.
1. Add noodles to bacon/mushroom mixture. Sauté until all noodles evenly coated in mixture.
1. Add hot mixture to egg/cheese mixture. Stir/toss until coated evenly. Add more cheese, if needed. Serve hot.


Love, because it&#39;s incredibly written by Norah Ephron and incredibly acted by Meryl and Jack. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs and Parmesan until combined. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta. The ingredients are simple—just spaghetti (or other long pasta), and the carbonara is made with pancetta or bacon, eggs, Parmesan, a little olive oil, salt and pepper.
