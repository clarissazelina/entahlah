I add a couple of thinly sliced radishes to give the salad a little color (paprika is nice, too). Watch your potatoes when you cook them. Salt the water and bring to a boil. The other thing I really like about this Bacon Potato Salad is the dressing. It isn&#39;t just mayonnaise, it is lightened up a bit with sour cream plus it has a mild kick from Horseradish Cream.
