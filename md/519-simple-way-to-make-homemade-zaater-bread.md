Zaatar Bread is the English name. The flatbread is better known by various names. Man&#39;ousheh is the single form for one zaatar bread and manakish the plural.


To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook zaater bread using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

1. Take 1 cup flour
1. Get 1 teaspoon baking powder
1. Get 3/4 cup yogurt
1. Take 5 tablespoon zaater
1. Prepare 3 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil


Labneh (strained yogurt) Fresh tomatoes, sliced. The first time I tried the za&#39;atar man&#39;ouche was in a Lebanese restaurant in Brussels. It was long time ago during a trip I took with my mum to Belgium, and that was the first time I tried Lebanese food.

##### Instructions to make Zaater bread:

Some za&#39;atar blends will have cumin or oregano in it as well. For its minimal ingredients, za&#39;atar has a massive flavour to it, which is slightly salty, and slightly crunchy thanks to the sesame seeds. Mix the zaatar and olive oil in a bowl and set aside.
