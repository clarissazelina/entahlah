- "Resting the dough for 4 hours with a few folds in between is the biggest tip I can give you. with wet hands I grab some dough from the outside of the bowl and stretch it out to the other side of the bowl, do between 8-12 folds. You will do this process 3 times. Just say you start your dough at 3pm, at 330pm I do my first fold and every half hour I’ll will do it again so at 4pm and 430pm. Then rest it until 7pm."
