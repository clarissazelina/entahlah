Flour: Most banana breads are made with white all-purpose flour. To add some whole grain nutrition and fiber, I&#39;m using my favorite baking flour: white whole wheat. You could probably use a cup for cup gluten free flour to make this gluten free banana bread, but I have not tried it, so I can&#39;t confirm!. You cannot swap a grain free flour to like almond. This healthy sugar-free banana bread is fully vegan and naturally gluten-free.
