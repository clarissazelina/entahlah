I use about three ounces of sugar free dark chocolate. And you want it pretty finely chop. Then we&#39;re going to put it into a glass Bowl sitting over some simmering water. For chocolate coatings, I always like to add a little bit of cocoa butter, but you could do coconut oil as well. Mix butter, flour, cocoa and granular.
