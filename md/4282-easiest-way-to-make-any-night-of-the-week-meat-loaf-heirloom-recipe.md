recipeingredient:
- 1 packages ground meat loaf mixture of beef pork and veal  prepackaged is over 1 lb
- 1 egg
- 2 slice whole wheat bread
- 14 cup seasoned bread crumbs
- 14 tsp thyme
- 12 tsp parsley  marjoram
- 1 BBQ or tomato sauce
- 1 milk
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°"
- "Take a 9&#34; x 9&#34; x 2&#34; baking dish and add a drop of oil. Spread it around so it&#39;s a light coating. This prevents the meat from sticking to the bottom."
- "In a large bowl add meat loaf blend."
- "Wet bread with a little water and squeeze to remove excess water, break up and add to meat. If there&#39;s too much water, the bread will be too mushy to work with.   Next add egg, herbs and seasoned bread crumbs."
- "Mix very well to incorporate all ingredients. The mixture will be stiff. Add milk a splash at a time mixing well after each addition until the meat mixture feels soft and pliable."
- "Form meat into a giant burger, place in pan and push in 2 opposite sides to form a flat loaf. As it bakes it will rise a bit."
- "Spread a light coating of sweet BBQ sauce over top and sides. Here is where I broke with family tradition instead of using a rich rustico Italian sauce. However, you can use a tomato sauce for an Italian style meat loaf."
- "Depending upon how much meat is in the package gives you your timetable for baking. The one pictured here was a 1.36 lb. meat loaf mixture. This one I baked for 68 minutes. The rule is about 1 hour per pound. I&#39;ve always taken it out 5 minutes prior and let the meat rest for 5 minutes or so before slicing."
- "Hint about meat thermometers. Meat loaf holds in moisture. Once you stick a thermometer in to check the temp then pull it out. All those lovely juices will come out too."
