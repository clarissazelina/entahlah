THE SECRET TO TRULY LEMONY CHEESECAKE. The lemon in this cheesecake is two-foldâ€”it&#39;s in the batter in the form of zest and also on top of the cheesecake in the form of bright, smooth lemon curd. When I serve this cheesecake, before cutting it, I like to pipe dollops of curd on top that I then smash-n-drag (technical term) with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon to create the flower.

It reminds me of the lemon cheesecake I used to always get at The Cheesecake Factory until the discontinued it. I made only minor changes to the recipe: I added the zest of one lemon, used crushed Nilla Wafers for the crust instead of graham crackers because I prefer the flavor, and I used two eggs instead of the egg substitute. Mix together the crust ingredients until well combined and press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the springform pan. A creamy, tart, no-bake lemon cheesecake that can be made in minutes without ever turning on the oven! Served over a simple graham cracker crust, this sweet &amp; tart summertime treat is a simple party pleaser that&#39;s perfect for your next get-together!
