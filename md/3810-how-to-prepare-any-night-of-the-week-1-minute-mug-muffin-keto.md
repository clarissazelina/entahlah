It will be moist at first, but as the muffin cools it goes away. I usually eat one warm with a bit of butter and save the other one for later. The leftover muffin reheats well in the toaster. Even on morning when I have time to make bacon and eggs, I like to whip up a minute microwave muffin in a mug so I have a little &#34;bread&#34; on the side. In a mug, mix all the ingredients together with a fork to ensure it is lump free.
