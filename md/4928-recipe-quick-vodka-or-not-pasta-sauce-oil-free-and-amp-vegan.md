Bring this vegan penne ala vodka to a potluck, make it for meal prep and serve it with chickpeas and roasted veggies, make it for the holidays too! Pasta a la Vodka (Vodka Sauce) Feel free to prepare less pasta and freeze leftover sauce- it freezes and reheats beautifully! When reheating, use low heat to keep the sauce silky. Serve this healthy and rich dairy-free tomato sauce with your favorite regular or gluten-free pasta, and you&#39;ll have the perfect quick and easy weeknight dinner in minutes! For alcohol-free, I think if you used the garlic and shallots, you could skip the alcohol altogether (you wouldn&#39;t need to do the long simmer, but you may need to use less salt, if needed.
