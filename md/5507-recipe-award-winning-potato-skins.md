Brush or rub olive oil all over the potato skins, outside and in. Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan (don&#39;t use a cookie sheet, it will warp, use a roasting pan or broiler pan that can take the heat). Sprinkle the inside lightly with salt.

If I am making a recipe that needs cooked potatoes (like Loaded Mashed Potato Cakes or Twice Baked Potato Casserole) I simply bake the potatoes and scoop out the flesh. Freeze the empty shells on a baking pan and then once frozen, stack them in a freezer bag. Scoop the mixture inside the potato skins. Check on them to make sure that the cheddar cheese doesn&#39;t burn. When they&#39;re ready, the skins will be nice and crispy and the insides will be tasty and brown.
