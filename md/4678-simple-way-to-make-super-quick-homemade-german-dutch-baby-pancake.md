-  Pancake Batter 
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 12 tsp salt
-  Filling 
- 2 apples peeled pitted and choppedsliced
- 212 tbs butter
- 12 tsp cinnamon powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 13 cup brown sugar
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the filling.  Melt the butter over medium heat, add the peaches, cinnamon and salt. Cook about 6-7 minutes. Add brown sugar and cook another 3-4 minutes."
- "Beat eggs, milk and vanilla extract with a hand whisker just until well blended. Sift the flour and salt. Gradually add the wet mixture onto the flour. Mix well until just combined. Don&#39;t overmix the batter, that&#39;s why you must sift the dry ingredients before adding them to the wet ingredients so you would be able to mix properly throughout the batter."
- "Grease with butter a 9 inch or 10 inch round/square pan (use a shallow pan, not more than 2 inches deep). Pour the filling into the pan (add butter cubes over the filling if you like) then pour the batter over it. Place the pan in a COLD OVEN. Bake at 450°F. Do not open the oven door while cooking the pancake. It will puff up and become crisp around the edges."
- "Bake for 15 to 17 minutes until the pancake is puffed up and slightly browned.  Remove the pan from the oven and serve immediately."
