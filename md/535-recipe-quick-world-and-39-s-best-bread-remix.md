recipeingredient:
- 420 g bread flour
- 340 mL filtered water
- 8 g salt
- 1 g dry yeast
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast and salt in the warm filtered water (around 35ºC)."
- "Introduce the flour and mix well, until there is no dry bits left. A silicone spatula works well to scrape the sides of the bowl."
- "Cover (with a damp towel, or cling film) and let rise in a warm place for 12 hours. Be aware that the dough will double in volume and make sure to use a bowl big enough for it not to overflow or stick to what you used to cover it. (See for yourself in the picture!)"
- "Pour out the dough gently on a lightly floured surface. Then fold it in thirds 4 times while stretching it lightly."
- "Prepare a bowl with olive oil and flour to prevent the dough from sticking (you might need to be generous!), then move the dough to that bowl."
- "Cover the dough then leave it for another 2 to 3 hours. Expect it to rise again!"
- "Put a big enough pot (cast iron or anything thick enough to retain good heat is best) in your oven, and preheat it to 250⁰C. You want to make sure the pot is VERY HOT or the bread will stick when you bake it."
- "Once the oven is ready, take out the pot, pour the dough in (you should hear a sizzling sound if it&#39;s hot enough), put the lid back on and bake for 30 minutes at 250⁰C."
- "Take the lid off, reduce the oven temperature to 230⁰C, then bake for another 15 minutes."
- "Your bread should be ready, with a nicely colored crust. Even though it&#39;s hard to resist, make sure to let it cool down before trying to slice it open!"
- "As I only eat 1 to 2 slices a day, a loaf can last me a few days. I usually slice the whole bread once it&#39;s cooled down, wrap slices individually in plastic wrap and store them in the freezer. A few minutes in the toaster in the morning and it&#39;s as good as fresh bread!"
