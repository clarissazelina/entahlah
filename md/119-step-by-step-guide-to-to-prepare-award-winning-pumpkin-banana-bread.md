Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, pumpkin banana bread. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

I really liked this bread but banana and pumpkin are both very strong flavors. Mixed together they kind of cancelled each other out and I couldn&#39;t taste a lot of either. I would use either all bananas or all pumpkin in this recipe.

The recipe was inspired by two of my favorites: Flourless Banana Bread and the popular Carrot Cake Banana Bread. Adding the extra cinnamon and pumpkin took it over the top in deliciousness, and this particular version is hands-down the best banana bread recipe on my entire website, at least in my opinion.

The banana isn&#39;t too potent in this recipe, but it makes this bread very moist and helps enhance the delicious pumpkin spice flavor that&#39;s. In a mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and the butter. Personally I prefer regular banana bread without the pumpkin but the pumpkin was still good! Made a double batch with my freshly baked and puréed pumpkin. This came out super moist and we had a difficult time waiting for it to cool because it smelled so good!
