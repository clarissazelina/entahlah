The garlic and butter really enhanced the flavor and these were incredibly tender! I ended up eating more of these than my salmon filet, which is big for me! Not only did I enjoy them, but all three of my kiddos did as well. They were popping them into their mouths as though they were chicken nuggets, lol!!
