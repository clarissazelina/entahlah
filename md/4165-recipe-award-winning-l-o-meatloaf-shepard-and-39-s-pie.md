recipeingredient:
- 5 slices Left Over Meatloaf
- 2 cup Frozen or canned Corn
- 4 cup mashed potatoes  fresh or left over
- 34 cup shredded cheese
- 12 cup sour cream
- 12 cup sliced green onions  optional
-  salt and pepper
recipeinstructions:
- "Place crumbled meat loaf in greased 2½ quart casserole."
- "Cover with gravy; top with veggies."
- "Combine mashed potatoes with 1/2 cup shredded cheese, sour cream and onions.  Spread over veggies."
- "Bake uncovered at 375°F for 25-30 minutes or heated through.  Sprinkle remaining cheese on top and return to oven for about 2 minutes longer or until cheese has melted and starts to brown."
- "NOTES:  I didn&#39;t have any shredded cheese, so I just used a couple of slices.  Mixed one in to the potatoes and put 2 on top, under them.  The sour cream I used had chives in it, so skipped the green onions.  Had a gravy pack, which I used, in place of the jar.  As I said, had L/O Savory Creamed Corn so just used that up.  I would guess that mixed vegetables would probably work well in this.  This is a picture of the L/O corn I used.  Only me, so didn&#39;t worry about the amount."
