This cupcake is perfectly moist with just the right amount of sweetness. There&#39;s fresh strawberries in both the batter and the frosting, so you taste the berries with every bite. I used solely almond flour for this cake, as opposed to a mix of coconut and almond which I usually lean towards. Golden Oreo cookies - The Golden Oreos make the Strawberry Shortcake Crumbs over the top of the cupcakes Strawberry Jello - The Strawberry Jello mixes with the Golden Oreos to create the crumbs. Neon Pink Food coloring gel- When using gel colors, it is easier to get a bright color with only a little bit of food coloring.
