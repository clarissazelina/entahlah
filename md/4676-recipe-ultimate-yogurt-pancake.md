Great pancake yogurt recipe?? but the trick to making the batter like a pancake batter with the yogurt added is to add more water until your batter is like your everyday pancake batter and add a teaspoon of vegetable oil and use self raising flour instead of all purpose flour and leave out the baking powder and baking soda and cook them just like you would when cooking pancakes out of the box. Yogurt pancakes are fluffy, a snap to whip together, and a great way to work some extra nutrition into the most important meal of the day. Oh wait, did we assume you were making these for breakfast?
