I talked all about sourdough starters: how to make one, and how to maintain one. It&#39;s so important to start your bread-making with a healthy, active starter. Sourdough bread is made entirely using wild yeast — with a strong, active sourdough culture of wild yeast, you won&#39;t need any commercial yeast at all. Wild yeast need a little more coaxing and works a little more slowly than commercial yeast, so sourdough breads are normally mixed, shaped, and baked over the course of a day, or even. 

##### Steps to make Sourdough bread:

1. Add starter to medium bowl and water and mix. Add all flours to mixed starter and mix well. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes. Add salt and roasted sesame seeds and mix with wet hands. Cover and let sit another 30 minutes. After 30 minutes wet hands and turn and Fold dough on all sides and do this every 30 minutes for the next 2 to 3 hours.

1. Place in floured bread basket or line a bowl with towel, dust with flour generously. Add sesame seeds to top of dough ball and flour the top. Place dough in bowl or floured bread basket with round top at bottom. Place in refrigerator overnight covered with plastic.
1. In the morning, uncover dough and let sit for 2 hours covered with towel. Place Dutch oven with lid in oven, afterwards and preheat to 527° F. Line Dutch oven with parchment paper, immediately turn dough into dutch oven with lid and bake for 25 minutes. Take off lid, turn oven down to 426° and bake for 5 to 10 minutes.


Spray the loaves with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour. Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each; a serrated bread knife, wielded firmly, works well here. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a rack. Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. It uses biological leavening rather than using cultivated baker&#39;s yeast.
