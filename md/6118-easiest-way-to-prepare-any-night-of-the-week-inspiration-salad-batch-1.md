BLT Salad Fry a few small cubes of slab bacon for about five minutes or until crisp. Puree an avocado, a handful of basil leaves, a clove of garlic, juice from one—or more—limes, about one-quarter cup of olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a food processor or blender; if you like a thinner dressing, add a few drops of water. Cut the courgettes into long thin strips using a peeler, and discard the soft, seeded core. Toss the courgette ribbons, peas and radishes together in a large bowl. Whisk the oil, lemon zest and juice, and yogurt together, then toss with the veg.
