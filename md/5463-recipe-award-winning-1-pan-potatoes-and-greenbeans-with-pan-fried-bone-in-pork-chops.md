-  Seasoning
recipeinstructions:
- "Brush one large or two small rimmed baking sheets with olive oil."

- "Toss green beans with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper. Add them to a section of the pan. I used canned green beans for this recipe this time. All I did was drizzle olive oil over the green beans and top with a little bit of bacon bits."

Place the pork chops seasoned side down evenly in the skillet. Fry on one side for about 5 minutes. Season the uncooked side and flip. Then fry for another 5 minutes. Times do vary on the thickness of your pork chops. I would make the porkchops last. Enjoy."
