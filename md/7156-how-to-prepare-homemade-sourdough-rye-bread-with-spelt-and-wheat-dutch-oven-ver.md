recipeinstructions:

- "Mix the the flours, salt (and caraway/sunflower seeds) in a bowl."
- "In a separate bowl, mix the rye sourdough pre-dough with warm water and honey/molasses."
- "Mix the dry ingredients with the sourdough mixture until all ingredients are very well mixed, 5-10 minutes. You can use your hands or a wooden spoon, etc. The dough is sticky and like a paste, so you don&#39;t need to knead it like you would other breads."
- "After mixing :)"
- "You can keep the dough in the same bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and let proof for 60-90 minutes at 24-25°C (75-77°F). If it&#39;s quite cold, then it will take around 3 hours."

- "Dust the shaped dough with rye flour and place fold-side down into a flour dusted proofing basket (banneton). Let rise again for about 2 hours."

- "When nearing baking time, preheat oven to 250°C/480°F. Put a Dutch oven/Le creuset or other cast iron enameled pot into the oven while preheating."
- "When the dough is ready to go and your oven is preheated, remove the pot from the oven, then carefully remove the dough from the banneton and place it into the hot pot so that the round side is now facing up."
- "Bake for about 30-45 minutes (my oven is pretty weak so it takes 45 minutes. For the last 10-15 minutes, remove the lid of the pot so the crust can get a nice color."
- "Let cool for a few hours or up to half a day until slicing. this will let the flavors of the bread develop further."
- "It doesn&#39;t look much different, but here&#39;s the version I made with a nice schwarzbier/stout beer. It smells amazing, quite different the non-beer version."
