Find Deals on Northwest Smoked Salmon in Groceries on Amazon. Great for a quick dinner or for meal prepping. So earlier this week I shared my southwest salmon burgers as part of Burger Month.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have southwestern salmon using 10 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Southwestern Salmon::

While salmon cooks, stir together butter, lime zest, honey and remaining ½ teaspoon salt with a rubber spatula in small bowl until evenly combined. For Salmon: Whisk together olive oil, cumin, chili powder and several chopped cilantro leaves, salt and pepper to taste. Grill well marinated fish on high- skin side down- until just after fat begins to seep from salmon flesh. In my opinion, one of the best proteins to add to your diet.

Don&#39;t try to be too fancy with the seasoning - just keep it simple! A little seasoning and fatty (fish) flesh meat will go. Farm raised salmon is fed genetically modified corn and dyes to make it appear salmon colored…use wild-caught! Additional recipes used to make this Southwest Salmon Bowl: Black Bean Salsa. Here&#39;s a healthy twist on a classic Cobb salad recipe: we skip the bacon, getting smoky flavor from chipotle peppers instead, and add salmon for a power-protein kick.
