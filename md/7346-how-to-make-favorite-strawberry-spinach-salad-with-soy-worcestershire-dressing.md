recipeingredient:
- 1 roughly 12 oz bag of spinach for salad
- 6 strawberries hulled and cut into quarters or sixths depending on their size see notes above for substitutions
- 1814 red or white onion cut into very thin slices later in the year the onions tend to be stronger and hotter
-  optional cubed avocado and toasted almonds walnuts or pecans
-  For the dressing
- 34 Tablespoons light soy sauce start at 3

- 2 Tablespoons minced shallots onion is fine in a pinch
- 1 Tablespoons water
- 12 teaspoon black pepper
- 3 Tablespoons vegetable or light olive oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all dressing ingredients except oil in a bowl and stir or whisk until all sugar is completely dissolved."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning before whisking in oil. If too salty (different soy sauce brands vary in saltiness), try adding a teaspoon of water. Too sweet? Try adding just a dash more soy sauce and Worcestershire. As a general rule, I adjust seasoning before adding the oil because the oil coats the tongue and makes it hard to taste the underlying flavors."
- "Whisk in oil."
- "Arrange salad veg/fruit on platter and serve dressing on the side. If you&#39;re planning to dress the salad before serving, do so immediately before serving as spinach wilts easily."
