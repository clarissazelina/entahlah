recipeingredient:
-  dough
- 2 14 tsp rapidrise yeast
- 1 14 cup warm water 105 to 115F
- 1 tbsp honey or agave syrup
- 2 tsp salt
- 3 12 cup allpurpose or bread flour
- 1 tbsp cornmeal
- 1 cold water
- 1 egg white
- 2 tbsp cold water
recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve yeast in warm water with the honey or agave syrup in a 2-1/2 quart bowl. Let proof 10 minutes or until nice and foamy. I use my Kitchen-Aid mixer, but you can also do all of this by hand. (I use the dough hook with my mixer, and let it work the dough for five minutes.) Stir in 2 cups of flour and salt. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle (dough will be soft)."
- "Turn onto lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about five minutes. Place in greased 2-1/2 quart bowl, turning greased side up. Cover with plastic wrap or kitchen towel and let rise at room temperature until slightly more than double, 1-1\2 to 2 hours. To put in a draft free area, I usually just place the bowl in a cold oven. Longer rising gives better texture, and typical French bread &#34;bite&#34;."
- "Punch down dough; cover and let rest 15 minutes. Grease cookie sheet; sprinkle lightly with cornmeal. Divide dough in half. Place on large cutting board or surface and pat and stretch each half into a 15 x 10&#34; rectangle. Starting on the 15&#34; side, roll up tightly. Pinch edge of dough into the roll to seal. Roll gently back and forth to taper ends. Place both loaves on cookie sheet. Using a sharp knife, make 1/4-inch deep slashes across loaves at 2-inch intervals, or 1 lengthwise on each loaf. Brush with cold water and let rise uncovered until slightly more than double, about 1-1/2 hours."
- "Preheat oven to 375°F. Pour one cup of hot water into a rectangular pan and place pan on lowest oven rack.  Brush or spray loaves with cold water. Place cookie sheet with loaves onto higher oven rack. Bake 20 minutes. Remove pan of water from oven. Mix egg white and 2 tablespoons of cold water; brush over loaves. Return loaves to oven and bake until golden and they sound hollow when tapped, between 20-30 minutes longer. Makes 2 loaves (12 slices each); 55 calories each."
