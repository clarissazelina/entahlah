- 5 lb red potatoes
- 4 boiled eggs chopped
- 15 oz Olive oil based miracle whip
- 6 strips bacon
- 14 cup sliced green onion separated
- 14 tsp celery seed
- 12 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup grated sharp cheddar
- 10 oz sour cream
- 2 tbsp yellow onion diced small
- 1 tbsp roasted garlic
- 3 tbsp sweet pickle relish
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and cut potatoes into bite size pieces. Don&#39;t peel them, it&#39;s better this way :-) cook till firm but done"
- "Cook bacon with the small diced yellow onion. I cut the bacon up a little, it&#39;ll cook with the onions more evenly if you do."
- "While the bacon and potatoes are cooking mix the miracle whip, most of the sliced green onion (save a little for garnish), the eggs, relish, pepper, sour cream, roasted garlic, and 3/4 cup (loosely measured) sharp cheddar, and celery seed in small/medium bowl."
- "When the bacon is finished, cool and crumble and add to the miracle whip mixture. Tip; this also makes a really good dip for those chips with ridges ;-) should look roughly like this....."
- "When the potatoes are done, get them out of the hot water and rinse with very cold water. You want to stop the cooking process."
- "Put the potatoes in a large bowl, make a well in the center and pour the miracle whip mixture in. Carefully fold the mix together. Garnish with the green onion and cheese. It&#39;s best if you make it a day ahead and let all those flavors &#39;marry&#39; overnight."
