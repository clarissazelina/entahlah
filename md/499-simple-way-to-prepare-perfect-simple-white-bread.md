Stir in lard, salt and two cups of the flour. Chef John&#39;s White Bread &#34;Almost identical to the bread Grandma made every Saturday.&#34; - Sonshine. This is by far the best white bread recipe I have ever tried. Because it is a little sweet, I usually make one loaf of bread and do a round cake pan with cinnamon rolls with the other half of dough. Also, I always roll out my bread dough, whether I am making loaves or rolls to help get rid of excess air-bubbles, and this really helps.
