Hello everybody, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, sourdough baguette. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into six pieces (for thin baguettes) or three pieces (for thicker Italian loaves). Similar to my Kamut demi-baguette recipe, I utilized a short warm, and long cold, two-step bulk fermentation for this dough. When I tested cold proofing these baguettes in shape the results always yielded a slightly thicker crust compared to a warm final proof.

Sourdough baguette is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions daily. They're fine and they look fantastic. Sourdough baguette is something that I have loved my whole life.
