Hey everyone, it's John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, flapjacks. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Use rich dark chocolate and light orange to make these fab flapjacks. Adding both the zest and the juice ensures a stronger, zingy flavour and a better consistency. Our chocolate orange flapjacks are a great weekend bake to enjoy with coffee at leisure.

Flapjack lobster (Ibacus peronii), a crustacean that lives in shallow waters around Australia; Flapjack octopus (Opisthoteuthis californiana), a deep-sea mollusc; Flapjack (plant) (Kalanchoe tetraphylla), native. Flapjacks should be moist and stick-in-your-teeth gooey. These were extremely dry and as others have noted they easily broke apart.
