Cut three or four deep slashes in each of the lamb chops, taking care not to cut all the way through the chop.; Combine the yogurt, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, Garam Masala, toasted cumin, cardamom, cayenne pepper, mace, and nutmeg in a gallon-sized reusable plastic bag. Add the lamb chops, then turn to coat them in marinade and refrigerate for four hours or even overnight. Carefully shake off excess marinade and place lamb chops onto grill. Spoon the tandoori marinade over the lamb chops, turning the kebabs to coat both sides of the chops. Set up the grill for direct grilling ( for charcoal or for gas ) and preheat to high.
