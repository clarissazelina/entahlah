I made it spicy and it was fantastic with a cool salad on the side and saffron rice for lack of jasmine rice. Nice presentation for a quick meal for company on the fly. I was worried about the sweetness using balsamic as the primary liquid and I thought spicy would be nice. Season with basil and ginger; stir. White wine vinegar is perfectly adequate, and red wine vinegar is even nicer.
