recipeingredient:
- 1 large egg
- 1 tbsp hummus
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 18 tsp cayenne or chili powder
- 1 tbsp onion finely minced
- 1 leaf coarsely chopped lettuce
- 1 bunch green salad OR 1 pc toasted rice bread  tortilla
- 14 tsp olive oil optional
- 1 tbsp shredded mozarella cheese optional
recipeinstructions:
- "On a small pot, fill with water about 5-6 cups (just enough to cover egg). Bring water to boil. Place egg on a spoon or laddle to submerge it at the boiling pot of water and turn down heat to medium. Let egg boil for 8 mins. Turn off heat, and let the egg rest on pot for at least a minute."
- "While the egg is boiling, toast your rice bread or rice tortilla, OR alternatively prepare your vegetables for salad."
- "While the egg is resting on pot, chop half of a small onion then place them on a small bowl. On the same bowl add hummus, dijon mustard, cayenne / chili powder, and olive oil (optional). Set it aside for a bit."
- "Fish out the egg from pot using laddle or spoon. Cool it through running water until bare hands can handle it. You don&#39;t want it too cold -- we want its heat to melt mozarella a bit for later."
- "De-shell the egg (careful it might still be hot) and place it on the same bowl of the premade mixture. Coarsely mash it, add shredded mozarella, then add 1 leaf chopped lettuce. Mix them well."
- "Serve the egg salad mix as toasted bread toppings, or as salad dressing. Enjoy!"

LIz and I have to hand to Trader Joe&#39;s for the inspiration behind this recipe - we both love. Since mayonnaise is not a local item for us, and also since it can be sort of questionable when used in stuffed eggs that are going to be sitting out on a table for a while, we&#39;ve found other options for making a delicious egg salad or stuffed egg. Really the possibilities are endless, but just a little moisture is needed. Put the eggs and all other ingredients in a bowl. 

##### Instructions to make Mayo-less Egg Salad:

1. On a small pot, fill with water about 5-6 cups (just enough to cover egg). Bring water to boil. Place egg on a spoon or laddle to submerge it at the boiling pot of water and turn down heat to medium. Let egg boil for 8 mins. Turn off heat, and let the egg rest on pot for at least a minute.
1. While the egg is boiling, toast your rice bread or rice tortilla, OR alternatively prepare your vegetables for salad.
1. While the egg is resting on pot, chop half of a small onion then place them on a small bowl. On the same bowl add hummus, dijon mustard, cayenne / chili powder, and olive oil (optional). Set it aside for a bit.
1. Fish out the egg from pot using laddle or spoon. Cool it through running water until bare hands can handle it. You don&#39;t want it too cold -- we want its heat to melt mozarella a bit for later.
1. De-shell the egg (careful it might still be hot) and place it on the same bowl of the premade mixture. Coarsely mash it, add shredded mozarella, then add 1 leaf chopped lettuce. Mix them well.
1. Serve the egg salad mix as toasted bread toppings, or as salad dressing. Enjoy!


Use the fork to mash everything together. If you hate mayonnaise, despise the white stuff, can&#39;t have it within a five-foot radius of your being, we&#39;re willing to bet that potato salad is the bane of your existence. A heap of delicious, freshly cooked potatoes, drowned in a bucket-load of mayo. It&#39;s a difficult sight to see for those with an aversion to mayo, and a tough reality to live (a life without potato salad, that is). Light and fluffy, minus the mayonnaise in traditional egg salad, this spread makes a scrumptious sandwich filler or protein-packed cracker topping.
