For my picky eaters I used onion powder instead of chopped onions. It was a bit on the bland side and should have looked at reviews of the original recipe first and. Rich in carbs and fat, it fills you up and makes you feel good — that is, until your waistband. The zucchini and onion stirred into the meatloaf already boosts the veggie count in this recipe, but then it goes a step further by swapping out a traditional ketchup glaze for a sweet tomato. In a large nonstick skillet, saute the onion, red pepper and garlic in oil until tender.
