This sourdough banana bread recipe uses discard sourdough for a thrifty quick bread that uses ingredients that might otherwise be wasted. One of my favorite sayings it &#34;use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.&#34; Not that I am able to live by it, but I love the sentiment and I think it&#39;s a worthy goal. Sourdough starter is an amazing addition to this banana bread studded with pecans, almonds, and dried cranberries. Sourdough banana bread is put together like a regular quick bread but it uses a cup of sourdough starter to replace part of the flour and liquid from a traditional banana bread recipe. The sourdough starter adds extra flavor, but doesn&#39;t actually make the banana bread taste like sourdough bread.
