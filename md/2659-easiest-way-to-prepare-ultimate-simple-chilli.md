I use a TON more chili powder than called for here. We serve this with shredded cheese and sour cream. The kids like to have this over fritos. This bean-rich, ground beef chili will not only be delicious today, but it might even taste better tomorrow. Adjust the red pepper sauce to your own preference, and be sure to serve this easy chili recipe with plenty of optional toppings, including chopped black olives, fresh limes, guacamole, shredded cheese, salsa, shredded lettuce and sour cream.
