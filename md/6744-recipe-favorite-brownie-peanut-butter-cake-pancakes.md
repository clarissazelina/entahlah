This single-serving Easy Peanut Butter Sauce for Ice Cream, Pancakes, or Waffles can be made with just two ingredients and is absolutely decadent and delicious.. Try my Peanut Butter Cookie for Two, Small-batch Buckeye Brownie Cookies, Small-batch Peanut Butter Swirl Brownies, and Small-batch Peanut Butter Cups. I made the recipe as is, but made a peanut butter icing in order to make it extra special! It made the brownies sweeter (the way I like them) and added even more peanut butter flavor! Remove from oven and sprinkle on choc chips, peanut butter chips and the peanut butter cups.
