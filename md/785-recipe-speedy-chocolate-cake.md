There will be times that call for intensely dark chocolate cakes. Chocolate flavour oozes all through this cake even though it&#39;s only made with cocoa powder, like our very own Fudgy Chocolate Cake. Whether you eat it plain, dust it with powdered sugar or serve with dollops of cream or scoops of ice cream, it truly is perfectly perfect! Don&#39;t know what really accounts for the difference since the recipes are so similar, and maybe it&#39;s just a matter of personal preference, but while this was a very good cake, I&#39;ll stick with the other. Our chocolate cake recipes include: easy one-bowl recipes, tiered cakes with frostings and fillings, mini cupcakes, Texas sheet cake, as well as gluten-free chocolate cakes and vegan chocolate cake.
