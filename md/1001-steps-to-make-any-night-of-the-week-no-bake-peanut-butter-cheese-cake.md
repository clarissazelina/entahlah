Pat and press firmly on bottom and up sides of pie plate. Cheesecake is one of the most delicious desserts I have ever tasted and this peanut butter cheesecake is the most awesome cheesecake treat I have ever seen. I bought tried my first peanut butter when I was a child, and I guarded it in the pantry like a precious commodity, of course, no one then even cared, but the neighborhood kids would come over and ask for a spoonful once a day after I told. Add softened cream cheese, peanut butter and powdered sugar to a mixing bowl and beat until creamy, scraping down sides. If you haven&#39;t figured it out by now, peanut butter is my thang.
