Balsamic Chicken is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. Balsamic Chicken is something that I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

Remove the chicken from the marinade and reserve the marinade. In a large bowl, combine balsamic vinegar, honey, mustard, and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Stir together the balsamic and brown sugar and add it to the skillet.

##### The ingredients needed to make Balsamic Chicken::

1. Take 1/4 cup (approx) Balsamic Vinegar
1. Take  Generous sprinkle of Dried Minced Onion
1. Take  Sprinkle of Cumin


And out comes this glorious chicken that&#39;s savoury, tangy, sweet and very, very sticky! Pour diced tomatoes and balsamic vinegar over chicken; season with basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme. This balsamic chicken is chicken thighs coated in a sweet and savory glaze and roasted to perfection along with potatoes and asparagus.

I love one pan meals because they&#39;re quick to make and the clean up is a breeze. Love balsamic vinegar, hope you enjoy this chicken. Note; I have found that it&#39;s better with boneless, skinless chicken breast or boneless, skinless thighs. Baking time may be less due to size. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
