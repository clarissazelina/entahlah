Punch down dough, and form into ball or loaf shape. This bread dipping oil is the best concoction of herbs, garlic, and of course, rich, flavorful olive oil. It makes a lot, but it stores well in the fridge for about a week. If you want to extend the shelf life further, leave out the fresh garlic and just add that when you&#39;re ready to use it. The olive oil in this bread makes it quite tender, while rosemary&#39;s piquant fragrance makes slices of this loaf ideal for hearty sandwich fillings.
