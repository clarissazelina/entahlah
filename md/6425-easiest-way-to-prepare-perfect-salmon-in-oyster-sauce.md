recipeingredient:
- 2 salmon fillets skinned
- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 garlic clove peeled and crushed
- 30 g brown sugar
- 2 spring onions chopped
- 60 ml about 45 tbsp oyster sauce
- 100 ml water
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in a skillet large enough to fit both salmon fillets. Add the garlic, followed by the sugar and fry for a minute until the sugar melts. Add the onions and cook them for further 2 minutes until softened a little. Pour in the oyster sauce and water and stir in."
- "Turn up the heat until the sauce bubbles and place the salmon in the skillet skinned side up. Cook for about 5 minutes until the bottom of the fillets turns lighter colour a third way up. Add more water if the sauce boils off and threatens to burn."
- "Turn the salmon over carefully, spoon the sauce over the top and cook for further 3-5 minutes, depending on the thickness. You can check if it’s cooked to your liking by gently prodding a fillet with a knife in the middle to see if it flakes and is opaque – or almost – inside."
- "Serve with the sauce spooned over the fillets, with green vegetables and rice or new potatoes."
