recipeingredient:
- 1 12 pounds hamburger
- 1 green bell pepper
- 12 onion
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1 package ritz roasted vegetable crackers
- 1 egg
- 18 cup milk
- 1 pack applewood smoked bacon
recipeinstructions:
- "Put hamburger in large bowl! Chop up the bell pepper and onion to your tasting and add to the meat. Add salt, pepper, and garlic powder, along with 1 egg, a pack of crushed crackers and the milk. Mix well with your hands until everything is well mixed and ready to make a loaf."
- "Preheat oven to 375 degrees"
- "You want to make a weave out of the bacon flat on something."
- "When your weave is ready pick up and shape the meat into a loaf. I usually weave the bacon on a plate so when I set the loaf in it I can turn it upside down to wrap the bacon easier. Once your load is wrapped tight it&#39;s ready to go in. I recommend getting a foil tray that has stuff that will soak up the grease underneath. Or a rack that will keep it off the bottom of the pan since it makes quite a bit of grease."
