Tiramisu is a popular coffee-flavored dessert that originated out of Italy. The traditional recipe uses whipped eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese. In this recipe, I have removed the eggs, which saves a fair bit of time. To help make the cheese nice and creamy, we make use of double cream. Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.
