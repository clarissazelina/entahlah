Recipe adapted from my gluten-free peach pancakes and vegan pancakes, with reference to Kelly&#39;s banana blender pancakes and Deb&#39;s apple pancakes. Applesauce substitutions: If you can&#39;t find applesauce, use plain yogurt instead (I know this works with regular plain yogurt, but suspect that Greek yogurt will be too thick). These healthy apple pie pancakes are an easy family favorite breakfast and a kid-friendly recipe! Thick, fluffy and pillow-like pancakes loaded with apple pie flavor and absolutely satisfying. They are a gluten-free, vegan, sugar free and egg-free recipe which is also freezer friendly too!
