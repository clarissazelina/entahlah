- "Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Then make a well in the center."
- "Add oil and water into the center. Using a wooden spoon or chopstick, stir everything to combine thoroughly."
- "Once the liquid is absorbed, start kneading with your hand for about 1 minute. The dough will be a little dry, but it should form a ball."
- "Leave the dough in the bowl and cover it with a plastic wrap or damp cloth. Let sit for 30 minutes."
- "Knead the dough for another 5 minutes. Then coat the ball of dough with cooking oil so it does not dry out. Cover again and let sit at room temperature for 4 hours or in the fridge overnight."
- "If you stored it overnight, leave it out on the counter for 1-2 hours until it gets to room temperature. Then transfer it onto a lightly floured surface."
- "Flour your hands and the dough if it feels sticky. Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Then roll each to a long log."
- "With a rolling pin, flatten each log into a rectangle of about ¼-inch thick."
- "With a knife or bench scraper, cut them into ¾-inch wide strips."
- "Preheat enough cooking oil in a pot or deep skillet to 400°F or 200°C."
- "Place one identical dough strip over another. Lightly flour them if sticky. Then use a wooden skewer or thin chopstick to press down the middle lengthwise. With one good press, it should be to make an indentation on both sides of the dough."
- "When the oil is ready, gently pull the two ends of each piece to stretch it to about 4 times its original length. Place in the oil and start turning it around with tongs or a chopstick after 3 seconds. This constant turning will allow the dough to puff easily and evenly. Fry until it is golden brown."
- "Repeat with the rest and remember to cover any uncooked dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap so it does not dry out."
