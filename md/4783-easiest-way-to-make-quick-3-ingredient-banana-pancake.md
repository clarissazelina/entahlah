recipeingredient:
- 12 very ripe bananas overripe is perfect
- 23 tbsp plain flour
- 12 tbsp milk any kind will do even coconut milk
- pinch salt
- 1 tbsp butter  splash of oil for frying pan
recipeinstructions:
- "Mash bananas in a bowl with the salt until it forms a smooth wet paste."
- "Add 2 tbsp flour and a splash of milk. Mix to see if consistency is like a thick batter. It should be smooth enough to pour into the frying pan but not as runny as regular pancake batter. Add more flour or milk til desired consistency is reached."
- "Meanwhile, heat a flat pan on medium heat with the butter &amp; a bit of oil (the oil keeps the butter from burning). Pour in batter and form either one medium size pancake or two smaller ones."
- "Cook for about 3 - 4 minutes on the first side until little bubbles form on the surface before carefully flipping over. Cook the other side for 2 -3 minutes.  If the heat appears too high, switch to a low flame. The natural sugars in bananas makes it caramelise / burn easily."
- "Serve immediately. I find this eggless pancake gets a bit chewy if it sits at room temperature so make it in small batches when you&#39;re ready to eat some easy, healthy pancakes :)"
