I know it can be a bold statement to call a recipe the best, but I truly mean it with this one. While some recipe historians trace the roots of carrot cake back to medieval times, we disagree. We know exactly where the best carrot cakes come from - the oven of a Southerner&#39;s kitchen. Moist, flavorful, and covered in creamy frosting, carrot cake is a perfectly delightful dessert that satisfies a certain craving in a way unlike any other classic Southern cake. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug.
