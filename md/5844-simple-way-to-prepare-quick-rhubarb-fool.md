Hello everybody, it's Jim, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, rhubarb fool. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Rhubarb fool is only one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Rhubarb fool is something which I have loved my whole life.

With a rubber spatula, swirl the cream and rhubarb together so that the mixture has streaks of rhubarb, but is not fully mixed. Spoon the fool into tall dessert dishes or wine glasses, and chill until ready to serve. This iconic British summer dessert is a light and dreamy recipe to celebrate rhubarb season: Rhubarb Fool.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have rhubarb fool using 5 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Rhubarb fool::

1. Take 400 g (1 lb) rhubarb, trimmed and chopped roughly
1. Prepare 100 g (1/2 cup) caster sugar plus 1 tsp
1. Take 1 vanilla pod, divided in half
1. Make ready 300 ml (1 1/4 cup) double cream
1. Prepare a few drops of rose water


Process rhubarb mixture in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a bowl; refrigerate, covered, until cold. Just before serving, in a large bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form. Bring to a boil and add the rhubarb. 

##### Instructions to make Rhubarb fool:

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C/375F/gas 5. Scrape the seeds from half the vanilla pod and mix into the sugar. Place the rhubarb in an ovenproof dish; add the sugar as well as the scraped two halves of the vanilla pod. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
1. Tip the rhubarb into a sieve placed over a bowl or a pan to reserve the juice. Discard the vanilla pod. Whizz the rhubarb in a blender to a smooth puree. Simmer the collected juice in a small saucepan until reduced and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Pour it into a small jug or a bowl and cool completely.
1. Whip the double cream until soft peaks – don’t over whip or it will be too stiff. Stir the rose water into the rhubarb puree and fold the puree into whipped cream.
1. Chill for at least half an hour, then spoon into serving bowls or shot glasses, drizzle with the syrup and serve. A shortbread or a ginger biscuit will go well with the fool.


Stirring too much will cause the rhubarb to break down. Transfer the rhubarb mixture to a glass or ceramic bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Put aside and allow to cool. Drain some of the juice and keep for serving. I now find that lusciously thick genuine Greek yoghurt makes the best fruit fool of all, as it allows the full flavour of the fruit to dominate.
