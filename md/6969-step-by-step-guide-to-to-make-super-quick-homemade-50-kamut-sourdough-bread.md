Hey everyone, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, 50% kamut sourdough bread. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Making food like whole wheat sourdough bread, butternut squash risotto, soup, whole-wheat pasta, and an apple pie or pear tart. Fermenting the dough with sourdough starter also enhances digestibility and complexity of flavor without adding extra work. With its creamy colour and close textured crumb, you could be forgiven for forgetting that this is a whole grain loaf.

50% Kamut Sourdough bread is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. 50% Kamut Sourdough bread is something that I've loved my whole life.

The bloom is wide, and the crumb is that classic golden color of khorasan and durum wheats. It is to allow more whole grain to be incorporated into our daily diet. You can find other sourdough recipes that I have made using ancient grains such as organic stone ground spelt and kamut flour. Though both are whole grain flours, kamut gave the bread a softer texture, both crust and crumb, compared to spelt.

I have even made this bread with a little bit of Rye in it. There really are a lot of possiblities that I can think of with the basic idea of how this bread is made. If you don&#39;t have access to Khorasan flour, please feel free to substitute any other whole grain flour. I love Khorasan&#39;s creamy golden color and wonderful flavor! The spelt flour is very soft and light and the resulting dough is very soft, but still bubbles up beautifully.
