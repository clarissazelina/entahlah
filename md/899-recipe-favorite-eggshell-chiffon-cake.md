Chiffon Cake is an airy, light cake made with vegetable (or canola) oil. The egg whites are whipped separately and folded into the batter creating volume and giving it the airy texture. It&#39;s different than an angel food cake because while you whip the egg whites separately, you still use the yolks! Two tips to making chiffon cake successfully are creating the perfect meringue with a stiff consistency and removing any pockets of air in the batter.
