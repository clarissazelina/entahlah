Crunchy rounds with potatoes and cabbage is something which I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look wonderful.

Low Fassum vs Crispy Roasted Red Potatoes and Cabbage. We used savoy cabbage because originally the little turkey that ran away with the entire tray of our Crispy Roasted Red Potatoes and Cabbage was going to make a Low Fassum. A low fassum is an epic whole stuffed cabbage,&#34; that is filled to the brim with salty prosciutto, pancetta and pork.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook crunchy rounds with potatoes and cabbage using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Crunchy rounds with potatoes and cabbage::

1. Make ready 2 cups wheat flour
1. Make ready 1 tbsp salt
1. Get  Barbaque spice(2)
1. Prepare  Sufficient melted butter

The result is a bowl of comfort, perfect alongside a corned beef dinner. Or, if you add some chopped corned beef to the colcannon, you will have a traditional English dish known as bubble and squeak. Layer half of the potatoes, then half of. Grass-fed beef needs at least an extra hour of cooking to get tender, so the slow-cooker is perfect.

I cooked the veggies separately in a large baking dish so I could control their doneness. I used a combination of turnips, rutabagas, potato, onion, and carrots, plus green and red cabbage. Blanching cleanses the cabbage and helps it keep its flavour, colour and texture. The following cabbage soup is a hearty dish, that could easily be called a cabbage stew. The parsley croutons are crunchy and the prefect addition.
