![Tofu w/ Ground Beef](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/68e0a492b5b9d3c1/751x532cq70/tofu-w-ground-beef-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hey everyone, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, tofu w/ ground beef. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

To cook tofu &#34;ground beef,&#34; you will need three main ingredients: firm tofu, oil and spices. You could prepare this dish with either frozen or raw tofu. However, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , freezing tofu changes its texture to a more meat-like consistency.

Tofu w/ Ground Beef is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They are fine and they look wonderful. Tofu w/ Ground Beef is something that I've loved my entire life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have tofu w/ ground beef using 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tofu w/ Ground Beef::

1. Take 1 pc tofu
1. Make ready  Ground beef
1. Take  Black pepper
1. Prepare  Oyster salt
1. Prepare  Flour
1. Take  Garlic and shallot, minced


Cook for a minute or so, scraping bottom of pan with a wooden spoon if necessary to loosen any stuck bits of meat, then add tofu. Stir in the soy sauce; taste, and add salt and red pepper flakes as necessary. A growing number of people are adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet because of the health and environmental benefits that go along with them. As the number of non-meat eaters rise, the processed food industry has been quick to adapt their products and create new brands to cater to this burgeoning multi-billion dollar market. 

##### Instructions to make Tofu w/ Ground Beef:

1. Cut tofu into cubes
1. Heat a wok add oil then stir fry garlic and shallot, after that add beef. Make sure that your fire is strong. When beef changes its color then add tofu. Add little bit of water then oyster sauce. Mix well then remove


But despite claims of being &#34;all natural&#34;, many of these products have. There are many types of tofu product on market from soft tofu to firm tofu, from tofu skin to dried tofu etc. Surely, the cooking methods actually depend on the texture of the ingredients. For marinating, soft tofu is more fitful than firm tofu and for stir-frying and deep frying, firm tofu is better than soft tofu. I agree with other reviewers that ground pork is the more traditional ingredient but I&#39;ve used sliced beef in this and the flavours complement very well.
