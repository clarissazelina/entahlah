Plus it&#39;s such a flavorful sauce so it doesn&#39;t even require marinating. Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words teri, to shine, and yaki, to broil or grill. That&#39;s the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks. In Japan, teriyaki is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. Crispy and juicy skinless chicken thighs stir-fried and swimming in a beautiful flavoured homemade teriyaki sauce.
