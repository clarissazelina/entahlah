Christmas cake ideally should be made at least two months before Christmas; this allows time for the cake to be fed at regular intervals with brandy, which, in turn, helps to mature the cake. However, if you are making it later, you can be assured the cake will still taste as good, though it may not store as long as a mature one. You can make your cake on Stir-up Sunday on the last weekend in November, but some people consider this too late. In our family no one thinks it&#39;s Christmas without this Red Velvet Cake recipe. It&#39;s different than other Red Velvet Cakes I&#39;ve tasted over the years, since this one tastes only mildly chocolate and the icing is as light as snow. 

So that is going to wrap this up for this special food christmas cake recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I'm confident you will make this at home.
