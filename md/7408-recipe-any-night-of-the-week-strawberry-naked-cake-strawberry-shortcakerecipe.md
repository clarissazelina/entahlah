My interpretation of the traditional strawberry shortcake. In a large bowl, beat together cake mix, pudding mix, eggs, water, and butter. I tend to go easy on my decorating when I&#39;m making a cake by piping simple roses, coating the cake in sprinkles, or even just leave the cake naked. For this Strawberry Shortcake Layer Cake version, I went with leaving the cake naked. A naked cake is a layer cake with barely-there frosting.
