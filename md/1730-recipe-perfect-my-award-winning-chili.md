Determined to come up with an award winning chili, I narrowed my sights to multiple-meat chilis and came upon Guy Fieri&#39;s Dragon Breath chili, which is the recipe I&#39;m adapting here. This chili contains chuck meat, Italian pork sausage and ground beef plus three different kinds of peppers (poblano, Anaheim and jalapeño) which results in excellent flavor, texture and heat. Lol, my son is so proud of this Award Winning Chili, he took it to a Chili Cook-Off a couple months ago and he won! He&#39;s been filling out applications for his own show on the Food Network ever since. I actually think its pretty darn adorable that he was so excited and I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised his Chili won, it was DELICIOUS!
