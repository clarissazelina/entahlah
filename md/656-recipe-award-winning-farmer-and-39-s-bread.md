Bauernbrot means &#34;farmer&#39;s bread&#34;, and, as the name implies, it is more common to find this kind of bread on farms. It is a bit heartier than a standard landbrot (or &#34;country bread&#34;), because farmers need a bread that will stick with them! This dense, whole-grain bread has sweet undertones from the rye, made more complex by the wheat and barley. So I&#39;m going to share the recipe for this low carb and keto farmer&#39;s bread, but first I want to take a moment to crow about it a little bit. I went to great lengths coming up with this recipe.
