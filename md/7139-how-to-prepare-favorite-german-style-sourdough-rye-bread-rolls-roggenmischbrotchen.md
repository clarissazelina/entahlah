- 100 g rye flour
- 100 g warm water
- 2 g rye sourdough startermother
-  Wheat Sourdough
- 100 g bread flour
- 100 g water
- 2 g sourdough starter I used rye but wheat is great too
-  Main Dough
- 170 g rye flour
- 120 g bread flour
- 120 g warm water
- 10 g salt
- 15 g molasses or honey
- 15 g butter
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the rye sourdough by mixing 100 g rye flour, 100 g warm water and 2 g rye sourdough starter. Let proof for 20-22 hours at room temperature."
- "Prep the wheat sourdough by mixing 100 g bread flour, 100 g water and 2 g sourdough starter (wheat sourdough if you have it. I don&#39;t so I used rye sourdough starter). Let proof for 20-22 hours at room temperature."
- "The next day, mix the sourdough starters with the rest of the ingredients for the main dough.  Mix with hands or a strong wooden spoon/spatula for several minutes until everything is evenly mixed. You won&#39;t be able to knead the dough like a typical bread."
- "Cover the dough and let it proof for 2 hours at room temperature."
- "After that, put the dough on a well floured surface and measure out pieces that are about 90-95 grams (or just divide it into 9 equal pieces). Form each piece into a round roll and dust with plenty of rye flour."
- "Place the formed rolls crease-side up on a baking linen or non-fuzzy towel/tea towel that&#39;s dusted with rye flour. Cover lightly with another cloth and let proof for 2 hours at room temperature, or 10-12 hours in the refrigerator."
- "When you&#39;re about ready to bake, pre-heat oven to 250°C/480°F. Place a metal tray at the bottom of the oven for that you can pour in boiling water for steam later on (or use your preferred method for steam). I have some volcanic rock on my tray to help make the steam finer (not necessary)"
- "When ready to bake, turn over each roll so the crease is on the bottom and transfer to a baking sheet. Cut a criss-cross pattern across the top of each roll with a bread lame or knife  right before putting in oven."
- "Put in oven in middle rack and pour in a cup or so of boiling water into the steam tray."
- "Bake for 10 minutes at 250°F with steam. Then, remove the steam tray and bake another 10 minutes at 210°C."
- "Remove and let cool on a rack."
