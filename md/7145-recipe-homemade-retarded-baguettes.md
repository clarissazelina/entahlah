Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, retarded baguettes. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Retarded Baguettes is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Retarded Baguettes is something which I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

I&#39;m reasonably good at baking baguettes, but one person who makes them better than me is Adam Pagor. Adam is a baker and makes hundreds of baguettes every week. So, I&#39;m delighted he agreed to demonstrate his baguette-shaping technique for this month&#39;s tutorial.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook retarded baguettes using 10 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Retarded Baguettes::

1. Make ready  poolish
1. Make ready 100 grams plain flour
1. Prepare 100 ml water
1. Make ready 7 grams active dry yeast
1. Prepare  dough
1. Get 300 grams plain flour
1. Get 200 grams very strong white flour
1. Take 12 grams salt
1. Take 250 ml water
1. Get 200 grams sourdough starter


While sourdough baguettes are one of the classic bread shapes and look fairly simple, they are actually a very challenging bread to make. This is because they require a great deal of skill, both in the leavening and the shaping of the dough. Only when you are much more familiar with handling dough and getting that level of fermentation from your breads would I suggest you attempt baguettes. Retarding is a technique that slows the fermentation process of your dough. 

##### Instructions to make Retarded Baguettes:

1. Mix together the poolish ingredients thoroughly. Cover and leave overnight
1. Add the remaining ingredients to the poolish and mix well until a rough dough is formed
1. Cover and leave to autolyse for 30 mins
1. Knead well for 10-15 minutes. The flour in this bread is mostly not strong so gluten development is important.
1. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight
1. Remove risen dough from the fridge and admire
1. Lightly dust your surface with flour and divide the dough into 4
1. Roll each piece into a long sausage shape, tapering the ends as much as you can
1. Place shaped dough in a baguette tin or on a floured cloth - folded so that the sides of each baguette are supported
1. Cover and leave to prove at room temperature for 1.5 hours
1. Preheat oven for 30-40 mins to 240C
1. Score your dough- along the full length with a razor blade
1. Throw a half cup of water into the hot oven
1. Bake for


This allows you the flexibility to bake your loaves at a later time. If, for instance if you want freshly baked bread in the morning you can schedule your bread baking around that by letting your shaped loaves prove more slowly in the refrigerator overnight. Making baguettes by hand was one of the biggest challenges I faced as a home baker. I tried recipes for several years and then gave up, convinced a baguette couldn&#39;t be made at home. But after about a decade of baking, I returned to the iconic loaf and came up with an award-winning recipe. 

So that is going to wrap it up for this special food retarded baguettes recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am sure that you will make this at home.
