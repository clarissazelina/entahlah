- 1 tablespoon or so of olive oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix together eggs and cooked rice in a bowl thoroughly. Add in that pinch of salt and set aside"
- "Oil to pan, low-medium heat. Add onions. Add garlic. let brown."
- "I didn‚Äôt do this, but this would probably be the time to add in a protein like chicken or shrimp ‚Äî or even some other veggies before you add in the rice/egg mixture."
