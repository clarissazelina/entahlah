- 5 lb red potatoes
- 1 lb uncooked bacon
- 1 large onion  chopped
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp Mrs Dash Original
- 12 tbsp celery salt
- 2 tbsp seasoned salt
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the red potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil."
- "As the potatoes are cooking, cut the uncooked bacon into 1/2 inch slices (keep all the bacon slices together to make the cutting easier &amp; quicker)and cook appropriately. Put cooked bacon on a paper towel-covered plate to drain but leave most of the bacon grease in the pan."
- "Place the whole chopped onion in the pan and cook with the bacon grease.  Stir occasionally.  They are done once you the onions start to become slightly clear (translucent)."
- "Add in the water, vinegar, cooked bacon, Mrs. Dash, &amp; celery seed. Mix well and let it simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes."
- "The potatoes will be done cooking once the skin looks like it is starting to peel off.  Remove from heat and remove potatoes one at a time with tongs and place in strainer. Let them cool off slightly for about 5 minutes.  You can either keep the skins on or easily peel them off while the potatoes are hot."
- "In a large bowl, start assembling the potatoes.  Cut the potato in half and set one half aside. Cut the other half into half circular pieces about 1/4 inch thick (more or less according to your liking).  Place each piece flat into the bowl making the first layer.  After the layer is complete, sprinkle a slight layer of seasoned salt.  Continue making more layers and after each layer is completely, sprinkle with seasoned salt."
- "After all layers are complete, put one last sprinkle of seasoned salt on top.  Pour the completed sauce on top of that.  Carefully fold the potatoes &amp; sauce together.  Cover with aluminum foil &amp; let it sit for about an hour before serving."
