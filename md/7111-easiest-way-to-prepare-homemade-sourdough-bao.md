recipeingredient:
- 80 g Sourdough starter quite runny straight from fridge
- 140 g All purpose flour
- 50 ml water
- 1 tbsp sunflower sesame or coconut oil
- 1 tsp sugar
recipeinstructions:
- "In the morning, dissolve the starter in the water and mix in all the other ingredients. Knead just enough to make a dryish dough. Cover with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temp"
- "Throughout the morning, do a cycle of folds every hour or so. Don&#39;t let it get in the way of life though. Missing a few folds won&#39;t hurt."
- "4 hours before dinner, the dough should have doubled in size. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, flatten and shape into buns (do that thing where you stick baking parchment inside so that the two halves don&#39;t stick together). Place on baking parchment. I like to put them inside a steamer at this point so that they are ready to go at dinner time."
- "Put steamer in the oven with the light on (in my oven this gives a temperature of about 40-50C). Leave until dinner time. Don&#39;t be afraid to prove the hell out of the buns. They should really be big and puffy by the end of this step."
- "Buns should be nice and puffed up. Now add cold water to the steamer and put it over a medium heat. When the water starts boiling, start the timer. After 15 or 20 mins they are done!"

Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, sourdough bao. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Gua Bao is a Vietnamese street food that I discovered one day whilst on the internet searching for new and exciting food to make. I wanted to make these as sourdough buns, so developed the following recipe. I am very pleased how they turned out, and the entire family enjoyed these buns, so I will definitely be making these frequently!

Sourdough Bao is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look fantastic. Sourdough Bao is something that I have loved my entire life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have sourdough bao using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough Bao::

1. Get 80 g Sourdough starter (quite runny, straight from fridge)
1. Take 140 g All purpose flour
1. Prepare 50 ml water
1. Get 1 tbsp sunflower, sesame or coconut oil
1. Prepare 1 tsp sugar


Sourdough Bao - Sourdough Surprises I first heard about Chinese steamed buns (bao or baozi) when Julie over at Willow Bird Baking made some cheeseburger stuffed baozi. I didn&#39;t make them then because these buns require a steaming basket and I didn&#39;t want to buy one and wasn&#39;t sure how to rig one. The first step in shaping bao dough is, well, actually having some dough to shape. Follow our recipe for a slight twist on traditional bao that brings some. 

##### Instructions to make Sourdough Bao:

1. In the morning, dissolve the starter in the water and mix in all the other ingredients. Knead just enough to make a dryish dough. Cover with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temp
1. Throughout the morning, do a cycle of folds every hour or so. Don&#39;t let it get in the way of life though. Missing a few folds won&#39;t hurt.
1. 4 hours before dinner, the dough should have doubled in size. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, flatten and shape into buns (do that thing where you stick baking parchment inside so that the two halves don&#39;t stick together). Place on baking parchment. I like to put them inside a steamer at this point so that they are ready to go at dinner time.
1. Put steamer in the oven with the light on (in my oven this gives a temperature of about 40-50C). Leave until dinner time. Don&#39;t be afraid to prove the hell out of the buns. They should really be big and puffy by the end of this step.
1. Buns should be nice and puffed up. Now add cold water to the steamer and put it over a medium heat. When the water starts boiling, start the timer. After 15 or 20 mins they are done!


In a small bowl, whisk together the water, yeast and sugar until the yeast dissolves. Flatten with a rolling pin, keeping the edges slightly thinner. Place twisted side down on to greaseproof paper in a bamboo steamer, leaving a little space between the buns. Steam Meat Bun (Rou Bao)Over the weekend, I decided to experiment with my sourdough for a steam bun recipe.
