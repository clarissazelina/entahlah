Hello everybody, it's John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, chicken breast in the bag. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Chicken breast in the bag is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look wonderful. Chicken breast in the bag is something which I've loved my entire life.

Place chicken in single layer in bag. Sprinkle any remaining seasoning over chicken and vegetables. Close bag loosely with nylon tie.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook chicken breast in the bag using 9 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Chicken breast in the bag::

1. Prepare 1 chicken breast
1. Take  For the marinara
1. Make ready 2 brunches of rosemary
1. Take 5 leaves sage
1. Prepare  Salt and pepper
1. Prepare 1 tbsp lemon juice
1. Prepare 2 tbsp white wine
1. Make ready 5 pieces juniper
1. Make ready 1 tbsp olive oil


I tried Maggi oh juicy bags which made the meat so tender but the kids found the sauce too salty so I want to make my own. The bag of Kirkwood breaded chicken breast fillets features an oven-cooking method. We do not recommend heating in the microwave as this will not result in a copycat Chick-fil-a sandwich. Place the chicken in the bag. 

##### Instructions to make Chicken breast in the bag:

1. Put in the chicken salt, pepper, olive oil, lemon juice and the wine.
1. In the special made,for the oven, bag we put the rosemary,sage, juniper (spices you can put as many you as wish) and we add the chicken and the remaining from the dish oil, wine, lemon juice and salt/pepper. Tight the bag with the special plastic band coming with the box of the oven bags BUT allow space for the air to rise.
1. Put it in a preheated oven 180 degrees and let it bake for 20/30 minutes depends the size of the chicken breast. The bag will get puffy but it&#39;s normal.
1. Let it rest for 5 minutes. Cut it in slices and....enjoy!


Then add the carrots, potatoes, garlic, and onions. My first observation after pulling the chicken out of the bag was the large volume of juice that came out, too. There is so little fat in a boneless, skinless chicken breast that it&#39;s hard to cook it without the meat ending up dry or just plain tasteless. With this method, we take advantage of the steady, all-surrounding heat of the oven, but just before putting the breasts in to bake, we cover them with a piece of parchment paper. Using a cooking bag to roast a chicken is a foolproof way to get tender and juicy meat.
