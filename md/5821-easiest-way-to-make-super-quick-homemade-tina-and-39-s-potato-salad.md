This French Potato and Tuna Salad recipe is my take on a French potato tuna salad that I grew up eating. If the words &#34;tuna pasta salad&#34; conjure images of gloopy mayonnaise and mushy macaroni, stop right there. Our lightened up, brightened up version is made with a lemon-herb vinaigrette and al dente rotini. The pasta salad is packed with fresh arugula, cherry tomatoes, and some pickled peppers for a pop of heat and color. Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover them.
