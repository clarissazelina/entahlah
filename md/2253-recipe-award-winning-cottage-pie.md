recipeinstructions:
- "In a large, deep skillet, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Once its hot, add the beef and cook until it is browned throughout. Drain out any fat, if needed, then set it aside on a plate and cover with foil."
- "Add the remaining oil and butter to the skillet. Once the butter melts, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Then stir in the garlic and tomato paste. Cook and stir another minute or so, then add the beef back to the skillet with the seasonings. Increase the heat to med-high."

- "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 8x8&#34; baking pan, then pour the beef mixture into it and spread it out evenly. Stir the cheese into the mashed potatoes (if using leftovers like I do, warm the potatoes up slightly first). Then scoop the mashed potatoes evenly over the top and use a fork to spread them out, being careful not to mix it into the beef mixture. Bake for 25 or so minutes, until golden on top and heated throughout. Then let it sit for 10 or so minutes before serving."

For a cosy meal on a cold winter night, try it with a side of Glazed Roasted Carrots and Sautéed. Wonderful cottage pie reminds me of the meals I had in my British school&#39;s canteen.

I forgot to dot extra butter on top but it still came out crisp with adequately brown. Cottage pie is actually older than shepherd&#39;s pie. Potatoes were affordable ingredients that were often used by the peasants, who lived in cottages. A traditional cottage pie is made with ground beef and topped with mashed potatoes. We used potato slices, which saves time and looks good, too.
