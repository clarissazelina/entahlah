Ina recommends placing a pan of hot water in the oven, under the meatloaf, to prevent this. Use ground turkey if you prefer. Since I have so much pureed baby food on hand, adding carrots and spinach was easy. If you aren&#39;t obsessed with baby food don&#39;t have this, grate a couple of carrots into your onion mixture for the same sweet (and healthy!) effect. Spread the ketchup evenly on top.
