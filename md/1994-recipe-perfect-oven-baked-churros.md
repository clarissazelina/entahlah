recipeingredient:
- 320 grams  Milk
- 40 grams  Butter or margarine salted
- 20 grams  Honey or condensed milk or maple syrup
- 100 grams Bread strong flour
- 100 grams Cake flour
- 2  Egg  M to L 
- 4 drops  Vanilla oil or vanilla essence
- 20 grams Melted butter melted in the microwave or in a hot water bath
- 1 Granulated sugar
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ★ ingredients in a pan, and warm over medium heat. Bring it to a light boil and then turn the heat off."
- "Sift the bread flour and cake flour together, and add them to the pan in one go. Mix them in rapidly with a wooden spatula, putting some elbow grease into it."
- "Keep mixing until the dough is smooth and has no lumps. Keep mixing it with all your might. (It&#39;s pretty hard work.)"
- "Combine the ● ingredients in a bowl, and divide into 3 portions. Then add this into the saucepan one portion at a time."
- "It is very important to add 1/3 of the mixed ● ingredients at a time and mix very well between additions until the dough is smooth."
- "Once you have added all the ● ingredients and the dough is smooth, put it into a pastry bag with a star shaped tip fitted, and squeeze it out. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 170-180°C."
- "【Tip】It&#39;s easier to squeeze if you put less dough in the pastry bag. If you can&#39;t break the dough easily, use the chopsticks to chop it off. This way, your hands won&#39;t get messy."
- "Brush the melted butter evenly over the churros, and sprinkle on plenty of granulated sugar."
- "Bake in the preheated oven at 170-180 °C for about 45-50 minutes. Please adjust the baking time depending on your own oven."
- "【Tip】To prevent uneven baking, turn the baking sheets around once the churros start to turn a light brown, about 30 minutes into the baking time."
- "Just after the churros are baked, sprinkle on more granulated sugar while they&#39;re still hot. Transfer them on to a wire rack to cool."
- "【Tip】The dough itself is not very sweet, so I recommend sprinkling the churros with a generous amount of granulated sugar."
- "【Tip】These churros are best eaten when they&#39;re freshly baked. But if you want to store them, let them cool down completely and then put them in plastic bags immediately to prevent them from becoming sticky."
