recipeingredient:
- 1 dehydrated minced garlic
- 2 pork chops 34  1 inch thick
- 1 salt
- 1 pepper
- 1 water to sous vide
- 2 plastic zip lock bags
recipeinstructions:
- "I filled my pot to the 1/2 Mark with water."
- "Then set sous vide (ultra) mode to 140 F using custom, no pressure, and started it."
- "Then I salt and pepper my chops, pressing the seasoning in, both sides."
- "The trick to this, is using a dehydrated garlic like this, minced. Powder will work, just not as much flavor I have found. I know, weird, right?"
- "Liberally cover your chops, and press the minced garlic in, both sides."
- "Now I don&#39;t have one of them fancy vacuum sealing bag things, so I used quart size, zip lock, storage bags."
- "I placed a chop in each bag, sealed the bag about 1/3 the way. Lowered the bag, bottom first, into the water, until only about 1 1/2 - 2 inches were above the water (not letting any water in the bag). This forced almost all the air out, then I sealed it the rest of the way, while still submerged. Took it out, did the other one. You can do this in a large bowl, pot, what have you."
- "Place your sealed bags in the water when it is up to temperature. Mine was at this point already. You do not have to put the lid on, or you can, doesn&#39;t really matter. Allow to cook for 1 hour."
- "Now remove from IP, turn IP off, it&#39;s done it&#39;s job."
- "If you want to sear them, dry them off with a paper towel so they take a better sear."
- "I think they don&#39;t really need a sear, and it didn&#39;t add anything, won&#39;t do it next time. But you do what you like. They are ready when they come out of the bag."
- "Notes - according to the internet; sous vide pork chops - 140 F = medium-rare, 150 F = medium-well and 160 F = well done. However with my IP 140 F I would say resulted in medium well. Since with sous vide, time is not the critical factor, either the internet is wrong (multiple sources said the same thing) or my IP runs a tad hotter in ultra mode. Next time I&#39;ll dial it in to 135 F. Your IP might vary from that."
