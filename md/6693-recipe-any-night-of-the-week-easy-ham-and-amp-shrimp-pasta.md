Take ham out of wrapper and rinse it with cool water if you think it feels icky. Then find the plastic doohickey on the large cut end and remove it. At this point you can trim off some of the fat if you would like. I usually don&#39;t, as most of it renders out into the pan or is very easy to cut around. Place ham in pan with large cut side down.
