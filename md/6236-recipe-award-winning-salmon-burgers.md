In my mind, I picture a delicate yet fatty fish patty, seasoned well, with a lightly seared crust and a tender and juicy medium-rare center. What I tend to get at restaurants is an overly firm and rubbery puck that&#39;s both dry and bland. For the burgers: Combine all of the salmon burger ingredients, except the coconut oil, in a large bowl and mix well. Patties easily fall apart until they are cooked. Heat coconut oil on a griddle or pan to medium-high heat.
