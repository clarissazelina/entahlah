By Patricia Cooper; Tropical Smoothie with Kale. Kale provides a nice green color to this tropical smoothie made with pineapple and banana for a quick and easy breakfast made with a NutriBullet(R) or blender. Numi Citrus Green Iced Tea sweetened with a Mojito syrup and garnished with a lime wheel. The addition of white rum in the recipe, elevates the flavours of the drink and makes it even more enticing in taste. But a few years ago, I tried a green tea mojito and I loved it.
