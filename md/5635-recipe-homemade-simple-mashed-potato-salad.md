To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have simple mashed potato salad using 10 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Simple Mashed Potato Salad::

1. Take 2 cups cold mashed potatoes
1. Make ready 2 hardboiled eggs - chopped to 1/4 inch pieces

It is ridiculously simple, but so tasty! I&#39;m not a fan of celery so I have it listed as optional because I never use it (I do add extra celery seed though). Peel cut and cook potatoes as for mashed potatoes. Add relish, chopped onion, celery, salt and pepper.

In small bowl mix vinegar and sugar, mix until sugar is dissolved, add Miracle whip and mix well. Pour into mashed potatoes, mix throughly If the potatoes seem too dry add more Miracle whip. It&#39;s not mashed potatoes per se, but it&#39;s not a traditional potato salad either. Like German potato salad, this mashed potato salad is served warm or at room temperature.
