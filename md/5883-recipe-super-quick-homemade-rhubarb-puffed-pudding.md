The classic rhubarb tart is probably my go-to choice of dessert at this time of year. If you buy ready-made puff pastry, then this one is super simple. After the hot rhubarb layer is poured over the graham cracker crust, a layer of mini marshmallows gets sprinkled over the top and the whole thing goes into the oven to chill. Before the jello has a chance to set, the marshmallows absorb some of the moisture and puff up into their own fluffy layer. Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat flour, milk, egg and salt with wire whisk just until smooth.
