Footnotes Cook&#39;s Notes: I usually use a combination of beans like kidney and black or kidney and garbanzo. I usually use dried beans and cook them in my pressure cooker. Homemade chili seasoning can be a great addition as well. In a medium-sized bowl mix the tomato paste, water, seasonings, salt, and pepper, and set aside. Add the onion and grape tomatoes to the pan.
