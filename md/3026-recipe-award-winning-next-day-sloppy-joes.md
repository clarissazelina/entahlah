recipeingredient:
- 3 lbs ground beef
- 1 small sweet onion
- Half a green bell pepper
- 1 28 oz can tomato sauce
- 1 6 oz can tomato paste
- Half bottle bbq sauce
- 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp Montreal seasoning
- 2 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp onion powder
- 2 tbsp granulated garlic
- 3 tbsp dark brown sugar
- 2 tsp white pepper
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the ground beef with the Montreal seasoning, 1 tbsp each of the onion powder, granulated garlic and chili powder."
- "Once the meat is cooked if there is a lot of fat/liquid in the skillet drain it out. I used a higher fat ground beef than 80/20 because it was on sale so that&#39;s probably why I had to drain it."
- "Return to medium heat and add the can of tomato paste. Stir through the meat and cover the skillet."
- "Finely chop the onion/bell pepper and stir into the meat mixture and cover."
- "Add the remaining onion powder, chili powder, granulated garlic and the white pepper. Also stir in the apple cider vinegar and Worcestershire sauce at this stage."
- "Reduce to medium low heat. Mix in the bbq sauce. I used Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s original sauce. Let everything simmer together for a minute or 2."
- "Add the tomato sauce and brown sugar. Let simmer for 10 minutes and adjust any seasonings if needed."
- "This is ready to eat now, but like chili I think homemade sloppy joe mix tastes better the next day. I moved it to a crockpot, let cool and refrigerated overnight. Warm on low and try to not over eat! I served them with Famous Dave&#39;s signature spicy pickle chips."
