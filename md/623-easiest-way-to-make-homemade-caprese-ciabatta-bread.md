Toasted ciabatta really is the perfect choice for bread--nicely &#34;bulky&#34; but not heavy. The family felt balsamic vinegar was critical to the dish. It&#39;s just a simple toasted caprese sandwich but somehow the combination of the melted fresh mozzarella with the pesto, the crunchy toasted ciabatta bread and the balsamic vinegar (that I can&#39;t figure out if they put directly on the pesto sauce or if they do a balsamic reduction like I did) makes it one of the best sandwiches in Manhattan. A Caprese Sandwich with Basil Pesto is a thick ciabatta bread stuffed with layers of tomato, mozzarella, and fresh pesto. Add a drizzle of a balsamic glaze and you will have a homemade sandwich that is better than anything you could buy at a restaurant!
