- 14 cup Plain flour
- 1 tsp Smoked paprika

- 13 cup Grated Parmesan

- 1 Egg
- 12 cup Vegetable oil
- 1 tsp Red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp Lemon juice
- 2 tsp Whole grain mustard
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 180*C."
- "Line 2 baking trays with greased/ non stick paper And throw tomatoes on one with a drizzle of olive oil, and bacon strips on the other. Bake until tomatoes split slightly and bacon is crispy. Remove and set aside."
- "Now cut spuds in half and in half again. Throw in a mixing bowl. Add plain flour, smoked paprika &amp; thyme. Toss to coat and throw into oven on a lined tray. Season with sea salt flakes and cracked black pepper. Bake until crispy and browned. Remove and Set aside."
- "Now to blanch your beans. In a small pot, cover beans in cold salted water. Bring to the boil and then remove from heat immediately- drain and refresh under cold running water. When cooled, strain and set aside."
- "Parmesan croutons are simple. Lay bread on a lined tray. Brush with olive oil, grate some Parmesan over the top, bake until golden brown, remove from oven and cut into bite sized pieces. Set aside."
- "In a small pot place your eggs in first, cover with cold water- bring to the boil. Remove three minutes after water starts to boil (for soft boiled) or 5 minutes (for hard boiled) and cool under running cold water. In May take a while to cook eggs, they retain a lot of heat and will continue to cook if not cooled properly. Peel eggs and set aside."
- "Remove outer layers of lettuce and discard. Wash remaining leaves, strain and rip into smaller pieces. Throw into a nice big salad bowl along with beans, tomatoes, baked spuds, crispy bacon &amp; croutons. Now tare eggs in half and add to salad."
- "What&#39;s left? Dressing! In a food processor, crack an egg- add red wine vinegar, mustard and lemon juice. Switch on and slowly drizzle oil into processor until it becomes a thick mayonnaise. Remove and drizzle over salad, season with sea salt and cracked black pepper, garnish with continental parsley and serve."
- "Easy! Ok- a bit fiddly, but the flavours and textures in this salad are great. Serves about a thousand as a side or you could just have it by itself. Enjoy!"
