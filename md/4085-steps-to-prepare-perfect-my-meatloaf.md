Adjust the amounts as you need or to your desires. My Favorite Meatloaf is similar to my mom&#39;s, but is kicked up just a notch. The few changes I&#39;ve made are these: my meatloaf has sautéed onions, a hint of heat, and milk is used instead of tomato sauce to add moisture. I have also added cider vinegar to give the glaze flavor balance. Within the pages of my cookbook, I proposed that people&#39;s perception of meatloaf became permanently skewed when a certain disheveled rock singer burst on the scene back in the seventies…but after much consideration, I&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s actually the word &#34;loaf&#34; that has contributed the most to meatloaf being such a maligned food.
