Spicy Mango Jalapeño Margaritas are just the right amount of sweet, smokey, spicy and salty perfect for a day outside grilling. Anytime we go out for Mexican, I order a spicy margarita but they are just as easy to make at home! Muddled fresh jalapeño gives such a delicious fresh flavor and spicy to cocktails. Use frozen mango (or other fruit of choice) for a blended frozen margarita, or use un-chilled mango and serve over ice for an &#34;on the rocks&#34; application. For a little heat to balance out the sweetness of the mango, I add some hot sauce and chili powder on the rim.
