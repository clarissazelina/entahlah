Like a lot of us over here, I was introduced to this tart by my grandmother who is an avid cook and a grower of rhubarb, where it takes up a vast section of her. The rhubarb flavor in this tart balances nicely with the honey and amaretto. The mascarpone cheese makes it rich and creamy. If using spring rhubarb, arrange it in the pastry case (shell) and sprinkle with the demerara (turbinado) sugar. Spread rhubarb in an even layer in the bottom of the crust. 

So that's going to wrap it up with this special food rhubarb tart recipe. Thank you very much for reading. I'm sure that you will make this at home.
