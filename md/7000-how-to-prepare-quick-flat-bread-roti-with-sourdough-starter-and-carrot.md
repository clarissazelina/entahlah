I have the sourdough starter from Goldrush(supposed to be SanFrancisco sourdough) and wondered about the King Arthur one. I make brownies, carrot cake, waffles, chicken and dumplings, etc. Doli Roti is a delightful Flat Bread leavened with a Spiced Sourdough. The bread belongs to the region of Multan and undivided Punjab and was a summer staple before urbanisation killed recipes like these. Doli Roti is a traditional deep-fried flatbread from Multan.
