recipeingredient:
-  Sourdough
- 350 g rye flour
- 50 g rye sourdough starter
- 230 g warm water 30C
-  
- 520 g warm water
- 22 g salt
- 50 g rye breadcrumbs from old rye bread
-  
- 550 g rye flour
- 100 g bread flour
-  
-  Other
-  Sesame seeds poppy seeds ryeoat flakes for topping or decorating
-  Nuts andor dried fruits to mix in I used walnuts and dried figs
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the ingredients for the sourdough (it&#39;s will be quite stiff). Let &#39;ripen&#39; for 12-18 hours at room temperature."
- "Mix salt with warm water until dissolved. Pour over the breadcrumbs. Let stand in a warm place for 1 hour."
- "After 12-18 hours, the sourdough should have some cracks and be ready to use."
- "In a large bowl, add the breadcrumbs + water mix, then the 550 g rye flour and 100 g bread flour, then place the sourdough on top."
- "Mix and squeeze the ingredients together with your fingers"
- "After it comes together and some of the stickiness has subsided, it&#39;s ready to shape."
- "Press out into a rectangular s until as thick as the back of your hand."
- "If using dried fruits &amp; nuts, gently press them into the dough."
- "Roll it up towards you (photo shows dough without fruits and nuts), and when almost all the way to the end, flatten out the end so it&#39;s the same width as the rest of the roll. Press out the very edge to taper it a bit to make a seal."
- "Roll the rest of the way and with the edge facing down, press down gently so it seals."
- "To decorate the crust with seeds or flakes, prepare a clean, moist towel. Roll the sides and top of the dough on the towel to wet it a little. Then roll the dough into a tray filled with plenty of seeds (poppy, sesame, etc.) or flakes (oats, rye, etc.) - they will stick to the moistened dough."
- "Gently lay each dough log into a loaf pan - it&#39;s hard to put it in straight so slightly bend the loaf into a U-shape and lay it in. The sides will rest and fill out while rising."
- "Let rise in a warm place for about 3 hours (35°C) - or until it&#39;s risen to about the same height as the loaf pan."
- "Bake at 230°C for 30-35 minutes with steam. If you want to add a little more color to the crust, remove the bread from the pans and bake for a couple more minutes.  (Note: the baker&#39;s recipe uses 230°C bottom heat and 200°C top heat for the first 20 minutes, then uses 235°C bottom heat and 220°C top for the last 10 minutes - not sure what the equivalent is in a home oven, so keep an eye on the bread)."
- "After baking, gently tip the pan over and let the loaf slide out (if still in the pan). Let cool completely before cutting."
