recipeingredient:
- 3 medium to Large very ripe bananas
- 12 cup Butter melted
- 34 cup Brown sugar
- 1 large Egg
- 1 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract
- 1 tsp Baking soda
- 14 tsp Table salt
- 12 tsp Ground cinnamon optional
- 1 cup allpurpose flour
- 12 cup Dutchprocess cocoa powder
- 1 cup Semi sweet or bitter sweet chocolate chunks or chips
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat your oven to 350°F. Butter a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, or spray it with a nonstick baking spray."
- "Mash bananas in the bottom of a large bowl. (You’ll have a little over 1 cup mashed banana total.) Whisk in melted butter, then brown sugar, egg, and vanilla. Place baking soda, salt, cinnamon (if using), flour and cocoa powder in a sifter or fine-mesh strainer and sift over wet ingredients. (My cocoa is almost always lumpy, so this is essential for me.) Stir dry and wet ingredients with a spoon until just combined. Stir in chocolate chunks or chips."
- "Pour into prepared pan and bake 55 to 65 minutes, until a tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out batter-free. (A melted chocolate chip smear is expected, however.) Cool in pan for 10 to 15 minutes, then run a knife around the edge and invert it out onto a cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.  The banana bread will keep for up to 4 days at room temperature. I keep mine wrapped in foil. It goes without saying that it has never actually lasted that long."
