She lives in southern Arizona, about twenty minutes form the Mexico border, so you can get. Authentic Mexican sopes are a thick corn cake that you can top with any ingredients your little tummy desires. I like to think of them as a thick corn tortilla boat because they&#39;re made exactly like a corn tortilla except the edges are pinched up to create a little well in the middle. Yes, you can bake anything that would normally be fried. However, the Sopes will not have the same alluring crispy exterior.
