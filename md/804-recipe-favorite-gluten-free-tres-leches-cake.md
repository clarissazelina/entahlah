Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, gluten-free tres leches cake. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Gluten-Free Tres Leches Cake is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Gluten-Free Tres Leches Cake is something which I have loved my whole life.

I was first introduced to Tres Leches cake years ago by a dear friend when we lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Tres Leches means three milks in Spanish, and this gluten-free cake is soaked in a sweet and creamy mixture of whole milk, evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk. The resulting gluten-free Tres Leches Cake is light but also decadent, with such rich flavors and a soft, spongy texture.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have gluten-free tres leches cake using 17 ingredients and 19 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Gluten-Free Tres Leches Cake::

1. Take  Cake
1. Get 1 cup all-purpose gluten-free flour
1. Get 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1. Prepare 1/4 tsp salt
1. Make ready 5 large eggs, separate whites from yolks
1. Prepare 1 cup sugar, divided
1. Get 1/3 cup whole milk
1. Take 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1. Get 12 oz can of evaporated milk
1. Make ready 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk
1. Get 1/4 cup whole milk
1. Take  Whipped Cream
1. Prepare 2 cups heavy whipping cream
1. Get 1/4 cup powdered sugar
1. Make ready 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1. Prepare  Ground cinnamon (for topping)
1. Make ready  Fresh strawberries (optional)


For my tres leches (three milks) cake I use coconut milk, homemade condensed coconut cream AND coconut whipped cream - which makes for one extremely decadent cake. While this gluten-free tres leches is very sweet, it&#39;s not cloying. The coconut whipped cream is lightly sweetened and complements the cake. Since almonds are a big staple in a traditional tres leches cake, I figured I would counter the extracts and nuts with Bob&#39;s Red Mill Almond flour, which worked to perfection.
