You can grill these shrimp (my favorite) or you can bake them, or saut√© them in a skillet. Shrimp is something that I actually tend to make quite a bit. These shrimp got raves from everyone at an appetizer &amp; desserts gathering. They were light yet substantial for an event that called for more than chips dips &amp; cheese. The shrimp marinated just a couple of hours before serving but it was long enough for them to absorb lots of flavor.
