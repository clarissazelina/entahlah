If you&#39;re new here, you might not know that I have a serious love for In-N-Out. It was always one of the first places we went to when we traveled to California, and one taste of their burgers brings back so many great memories! One of my favorite memories is a little funny, and, to be.

Animal Style Salad is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They're nice and they look wonderful. Animal Style Salad is something which I have loved my whole life.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have animal style salad using 9 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Animal Style Salad::

1. Get 1 lbs regular ground beef (not lean, too dry)

This is a hearty salad and it&#39;s FILLING with all these veggie goodies. The ground beef is cooked in mustard to give it that twang, saut√© the onions up and that&#39;s all you need to cook. Add a nice power green mix as the base, top with tomato, pickle. The standard style of burger includes tomato , hand-leafed lettuce and &#34; spread &#34;, a sauce similar to Thousand Island dressing.

Urban myth or just plain excellent customer service? Ok, you&#39;ve heard the rumors, wondered what was on it, maybe even felt a little left out of the loop. Requesting anything on the menu &#34;animal style&#34; automatically adds extra spread and grilled chopped onions. For burgers, it also means automatic mustard grilled patties, extra pickles, and extra deliciousness. If for some reason you&#39;ve decided to step into In-N-Out as a non-meat eater, no worries.
