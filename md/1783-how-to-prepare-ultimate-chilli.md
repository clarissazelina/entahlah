The family loved it they even went back for seconds and the men had thirds. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. In a medium sized stock pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Saute onion, chile pepper and garlic until soft. The chili pepper (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli), from Nahuatl chīlli (Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːlːi] ()), is the fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum which are members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.
