recipeinstructions:
- "Cut chicken into pieces.

Reserve chicken and strain stock, discard veggies."

- "When you are done with the dough, add oil to a pan and stirfry chopped onion, carrot, leek and celery. Reseve. Stirfry bacon (optional) and mushrooms. Reserve together with the rest of the veggies."
- "When the chicken has cooled down, remove meat from bones and cut in bite size pieces (size to taste). Be sure to prevent bone or cartilage to mix with the meat. Discard bones."

(There should be some excess dough that you can use for decoration or some extra biscuits). Fill the bottom dough with the mix in the pan, making sure it does not overflow."
- "Cover with top dough, cut excess dough off and stick edges together and roll them in. Use part (or all) of the excess dough to add ornaments to the dough."
- "Brush eggwhite on top of dough and make small wholes evenly to let steam escape."
- "Bake in oven for 20-30 mins, until top crust is cooked and browned. Let rest for 5-10 mins before serving."

Add in some crispy bacon and delicious shortcrust pastry and this easy chicken pie recipe is a winner! Leftover chicken from a deli rotisserie bird or from a roast turkey can be mixed in with the frozen vegetables for a heartier pie. Seasoning the base vegetable mixture with your favorite blend of dried herbs‚Äîsage, basil, oregano, or dill will bump up the flavor quotient. The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it tasted great but was too dry.

It was perfectly moist without being runny, and the pie shells were. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Chicken pie filling can be frozen for up to three months. Add pastry to the defrosted filling and bake until the pastry is cooked through and the filling is piping hot. When I was an ambitious lass in the corporate world juggling university in the evenings, Chicken Pot Pie was a handy one-dish freezer-friendly meal that I could cram loads of extra veggies into.
