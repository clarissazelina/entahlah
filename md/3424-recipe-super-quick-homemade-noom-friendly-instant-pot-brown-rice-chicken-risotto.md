Great recipe for Instant Pot Chicken Taco Bake. One night when I was planning on making tacos for the kids, I discovered that I was out of taco shells. I had already made the filling and I didn&#39;t have time to run out to the store so I took some tortillas and made this bake instead. The orzo was added to the pot after the pressure cooking time was up and the rice was added straight into the Instant Pot from the beginning. If you want more a creamy tasting soup then use the rice.
