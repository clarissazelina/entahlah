When I say easy, I mean easy to make Pulled Pork!! Making pulled pork in an Instant Pot is a little different than slow cooker pulled pork. The Instant Pot gives you the ability to sear the meat, which is a great way to add additional flavor. If you are pressed for time, you can skip that step, but the maillard reaction that browns the meat will add another layer of flavor. 

##### Instructions to make Ninja Foodie/ Instant Pot Pulled Pork:

1. Combine all the ingredients in an 8 quart Instant pot.
Add the lid and set the valve to sealing.
Cook at high pressure for 90 minutes.
Do a quick release of the pressure and remove the lid.
Shred with two forks or with your hand mixer.
Stir in more bbq sauce if desired.
1. Serve on toasted buns.
1. Drain off any liquid if itâ€™s to much, as you can see my was way too liquid, after I shred it I then Took the liquid out, but not all of it, because I donâ€™t want it to dry out or because iam saving some for leftovers.. (think I made a mistake using open pit for the bbq sauce, itâ€™s a thin sauce, I did add more bbq to the sandwiches, I have a picky eater who not for much bbq.)
1. I used liquid smoke instead of Worcestershire sauce... to give it that smoky flavor. I also seared my butt lol ðŸ˜‚ but you donâ€™t have too.


Add tomato paste and stir to incorporate. Stir occasionally, using a wooden spoon or silicone tongs to shred the pork. Tear each uncooked biscuit so that it is in two halves, like a hamburger bun. Place biscuit halves evenly across the surface of the pork. I served this pulled pork for BBQ sandwiches at my son&#39;s first birthday party.
