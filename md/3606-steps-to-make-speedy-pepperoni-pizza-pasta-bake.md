It&#39;s all of the goodness of pepperoni &#34;pizza&#34; flavors, wrapped into a delicious and uber-simple pasta bake. We would always just use pasta, pepperoni, Mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce, which was a fabulous start. For a &#34;lighter&#34; version, you could of course sub in some turkey pepperoni, whole. Cook the pasta as directed on the box, drain and return to the pan.
