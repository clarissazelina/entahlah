Tips for the Best Gluten-Free Pot Pie. Almond meal (ground raw almonds with their skins on) and blanched almond flour (finely ground blanched and skinless almonds) are different. This paleo chicken pot pie uses blanched almond flour and will not work as well with almond meal.; Your butter or Ghee has to be ice cold if you want a flaky crust!; I used rotisserie chicken meat but cubed turkey also. This chicken pot pie has a butter and almond flour crust with a filling made from carrots, parsnips, red onion, fresh collards or other greens, chicken, and mushrooms. If you&#39;re opposed to potato starch, use arrowroot, but add it gradually and stop when it&#39;s thick enough for you.
