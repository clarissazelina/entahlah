Picadillo is a traditional dish in Spain, in many Latin American countries and in the Philippines that is similar to hash. Its name originates from the Spanish word &#34;picar&#34; which means &#34;to mince&#34; which explains the presence of ground beef. Saute garlic, onion and green pepper until onions are transparent. Transfer onion mixture to a bowl and set aside. In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil until shimmering.
