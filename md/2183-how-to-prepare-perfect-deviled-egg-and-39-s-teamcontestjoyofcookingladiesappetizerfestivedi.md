I&#39;m happy to be this recipe&#39;s first reviewer, the first but not the last, I&#39;m sure, to say this is a great deviled egg recipe Suzanne. Editor&#39;s tip: Use this genius hack to make sure your deviled eggs don&#39;t have off-centered yolks. When the eggs are cool enough to handle, remove the peels. One of our favorite ways to peel hard-boiled eggs is to roll the egg back and forth on a hard surface while applying slight pressure. The shell will crack and become easier to peel off.
