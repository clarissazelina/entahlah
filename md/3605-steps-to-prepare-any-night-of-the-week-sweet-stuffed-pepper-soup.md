recipeinstructions:
- "Turn your Instant pot to the saute setting. Or just brown the hamburger on the stove top."
- "Brown hamburger meat, then the drain grease, put back in pot add onions and cut peppers, then add dry seasoning, cook till the onions and peppers are to your liking, or soft."
- "Place everything else (except the rice) into the instant pot. Stir to combine."

I used whatever spices I had on hand and made to taste, measurements I was guessing, and I used some other spices I can’t even remember, use what you have and like... same with the peppers. I had sweet peppers and I needed to do something with them before they went bad, just use what you like, and have on hand."
