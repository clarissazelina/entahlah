Your guests will love this any time of day! RICARDO. we went to iga and asked for fresh salmon for this receipe. i was advised that for tartare, you always take fresh frozen salmon because the extreme temps kill of the harmful bacterias. he refered me to the frozen section and showed me a pre-prepared frozen pakage, all ready cut for tartare. hesitant to think it was the fresh i was looking for! it . Despite the fact that the name sounds fancy, it&#39;s actually really easy to prepare and makes a fantastic light appetizer.
