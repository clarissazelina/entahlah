-  Whatever protein you have on hand

recipeinstructions:
- "...so next time you have leftover steamed rice from cooking or takeout, stick it in the fridge for two or three days, and make yourself a delicious fried rice with whatever veg and meat you&#39;ve got laying around along with some soy sauce, oyster sauce, or even fish sauce (or combination thereof), as seasoning."
- "Onion and garlic always help along the savory flavor, and a teeny, tiny bit of ketchup can add a subtle tangy backdrop to contrast and accentuate all the other flavors."
- "And not that you can&#39;t make decent fried rice with freshly made rice, but if you do, you&#39;ll want to use just slightly less water than usual (like maybe a Tablespoon less per cup), then fluff the cooked rice and spread it out in a thin layer on a sheet pan or cookie sheet and let it cool completely before adding to your other seasoned ingredients. This will prevent a bit of the sogginess you get from making fried rice with the freshly made stuff."
