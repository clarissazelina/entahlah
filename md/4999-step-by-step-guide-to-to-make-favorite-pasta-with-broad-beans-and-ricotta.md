recipeingredient:
- 300 g conchiglie or other short shape pasta
- 400 g fresh broad beans
- 1 small lettuce
- 1 small onion
- 12 red chilli
- 23 anchovy fillets
- 250 g ricotta
- 1 white wine
-  salt pepper and olive oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the beans from their fluffy pods. These ones are quite small, so I used them straight away, but if they have a tough skin you can boil them for 2-3 minutes and then peel them. That&#39;s a bit of work though..."
- "Chop the onions and chilli finely. Heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large non-stick pan and add half a teaspoon of salt (helps to keep the veggies crispy). Add the chopped onions, chilli and the anchovies."
- "Fry for five minutes or so until golden and the anchovies have melted into a paste. Take care not to burn the onions!"
- "Add the broad beans and cover with a lid. Cook for ten minutes on low heat, stirring often. in the meantime, chop the lettuce coarsely and start cooking the pasta in boiling water."
- "Add the lettuce and cook for a couple of minutes only so that it keeps its crunch."
- "Mix in the white wine and remove from the heat (so that the wine doesn&#39;t leave an acidic taste). Roughly chop the ricotta."
- "Cook the pasta al dente or a minute under, drain it and add it to the pan. Switch the heat to high and toss for a minute or two until fully mixed."
- "Divide into the serving plates, spread the ricotta on top and grind some pepper. You can sprinkle with olive oil or even lemon zest if you like it."
- "Buon appetito!"
