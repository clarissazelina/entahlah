Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, black baguette (homemade sourdough starter version). It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Black Baguette (Homemade Sourdough Starter Version) is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. Black Baguette (Homemade Sourdough Starter Version) is something which I have loved my entire life.

Similar to my Kamut demi-baguette recipe, I utilized a short warm, and long cold, two-step bulk fermentation for this dough. When I tested cold proofing these baguettes in shape the results always yielded a slightly thicker crust compared to a warm final proof. First thing you&#39;ll notice is that this is a lower hydration recipe.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook black baguette (homemade sourdough starter version) using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

It&#39;s much easier than you think it is! For many, the French-style sourdough boule (a giant round of crusty sourdough goodness) is the queen of from-scratch breads. Much like with baguettes, the less you work the dough, the better the final boule loaf will be. This recipe uses our sourdough starter recipe.

I&#39;m completely fascinated by the science of sourdough and how simple and effective it is in baking. Forgive me if this has been asked before, but I am having trouble finding out how much of a sourdough starter do you add to a bread mix. Place a baguette pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Line each well of baguette pan with thin strips of parchment paper. Starting with top edge, fold top third of dough to center, pressing to seal.
