For his eighth birthday, I made cake pops with a rich chocolate cake center and a yummy peanut butter coating. These are sure to be winners at parties, bake sales and sports-watching events. Neat trick: if too much chocolate pools around the bottom of the ball, just take a toothpick and score a line around the base of the ball. When it&#39;s dry, the cake ball will separate from the extra pooled chocolate.

This the sweet and frilly and fancy part. When the candy coating is set (no longer wet and glossy), heat up the chocolate again. However, we want you to have your delicious cake balls as soon as possible, so often orders can be ready. Let cool then break cake into small crumbs. In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter until smooth, then add sugar and beat until combined.
