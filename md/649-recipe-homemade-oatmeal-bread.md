I love oatmeal bread and expected the wonderful taste of oatmeal to shine in this recipe. However the major flavor is the molasses. I followed the recipe exactly and was a little worried about the amount of molasses but I read all the shining reviews I thought I would take a chance. Sorry but this bread should maybe be named &#34;Molasses Oatmeal. To make the overnight soaker: In a mixing bowl, combine the oats and water.
