To make it Paleo, replace the brown sugar with coconut sugar and rub, rub, rub that salmon until it&#39;s coated, and then cook it until it&#39;s perfectly flaky and irresistible. To make it extra wholesome and rich, I poach eggs in the filling. This makes it a prefect meal for breakfast or brunch. I would actually eat it any time of the day, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. We look forward to seeing you!
