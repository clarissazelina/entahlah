recipeinstructions:
- "Heat your deep fryer to 360 degrees. If you are doing in a pot, keep a candy thermometer close. It is important to keep the oil at a constant temperature."
- "For the batter, mix all dry ingredients, then incorporate the wet ones. Bring to a thick pancake batter."
- "This was the tricky part. The first couple stuck to the basket. Then opened and pulled the batter off. So after trial and error, this was my solution. Most important, dry the surface of the dogs with paper towels."
- "Take half a skewer, insert in dog. Place batter in a tall, skinny, wide mouthed quart jar. Dip dog in batter and roll to coat. Coat up the stick. Let dog drain excess batter. Turn 180 degrees and let batter run the other way for a few seconds. As close to the oil as you can handle, hold the tip of the battered dog in the oil. Do this about 10 seconds. The tip of the dog won&#39;t stick to the basket. Gently drop in. Immediately set a time for 3 minutes."
- "After a minute hold tip of dog down that is wanting to float. Use a long fork or spoon."
- "Drain on paper towels."
- "Garnish with desired ingredients. Enjoy"
