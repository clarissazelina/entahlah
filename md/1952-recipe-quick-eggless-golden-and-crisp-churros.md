Ensure you fry on medium heat and not high heat, as the Churros need to get cooked from the inside. Golden and crisp on the outside, pillowy and soft on the inside, churros are strings of deep-fried dough pastry. Traditional in Spain and Portugal, churros are dusted with sugar and are often served with hot chocolate or dulce de leche, but are good to be had by themselves, as well. Crispy, light, and sweet, these air-fried churros are just as tasty as the deep-fried version. The dough is perfectly tender and tastes like a lightly sweetened breadstick, while the cinnamon sugar adds the perfect crunchy texture and sweetness.
