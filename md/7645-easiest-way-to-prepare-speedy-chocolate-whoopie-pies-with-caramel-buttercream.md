- "Add cocoa powder, instant espresso, yogurt (or sour cream or eggs) and beat well for a couple minutes."
- "Sift in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and add a couple tablespoons of the milk / buttermilk. Start mixing slowly and add more milk, if required. Make sure there are no lumps in the batter. Do no over mix or you&#39;ll end up with a tough texture."
- "If you have any leftover batter on the spoon, put some under the parchment paper on the cookie sheet. This helps the parchment stick to the sheet and not move."
- "Using an ice cream scoop or a 1 tablespoon measure spoon, scoop out the batter and place it on the baking sheet at a distance of 1 inch from each other."
- "Bake at 160 C for 8-12 minutes or until the cookies are fully cooked through. Depending on the size of your pies, they will take anywhere between 7 to 11 minutes so keep an eye on them."

- "Then mix well for 2-3 minutes to form a smooth chocolate ganache. Keep it refrigerated until use."
- "Separate the cookies. On the bootom of one half of the cookies, apply some chocolate ganache (that has thickened). You can also sprinkle some chocolate chips or sprinkles or nuts."
- "One the other half of the cookies, spread some of the caramel buttercream filling."
- "Sandwich both kinds of cookies and place on a plate."
- "If you want, you can dip one top of the pies in some melted ganache, sprinkle some more nuts or chocolate hcips and refrigerate for 15 minutes for everything to set."

Swiss meringue buttercream - this is more for the advanced baker, so if you feel like you can do this, definitely go for it. It has an amazing flavor and texture, and it&#39;s similar to the traditional marshmallow filling found in whoopie pies. For today&#39;s variation, I decided to go with a Salted Caramel Whoopie Pie, because duh, salted caramel! For the salted caramel buttercream in the filling, I use a quick homemade caramel sauce. The only thing that takes time is to let the caramel sauce cool down before proceeding to make the buttercream.
