Unlike many chocolate desserts, this dark chocolate pie contains more cocoa than sweetener - a dream for chocoholics who like a deep, rich flavor. The cayenne in this recipe is what gives it a passionate Mayan heat, but you can tone it down or omit it altogether for a simple dark chocolate pie. Sprinkle chopped pecans and chocolate chips into pastry shell. In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, corn syrup, butter, liqueur, pepper and vanilla. Pour into pastry; arrange pecan halves over filling.
