recipeingredient:
- 2 tbsp instant coffee you want the freezedried stuff
- 2 tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp boiling water
-  Milk can vary
-  Cocoa powder optional
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the coffee, sugar and hot water in a bowl, and whip on high with an electric mixer until frothy. If you are daring, then feel free to do this by hand, you just might be a bit longer..."
- "Once quadrupled in size and is a thick, light chocolatey brown, stop beating the mixture."
- "Fill your glass with milk 3/4 of the way. You can use chocolate milk if you want a whipped mocha."
- "Spoon the fluffy coffee on top and sprinkle with cocoa powder if you wish. Enjoy this humble but absolutely stunning drink."
- "Tips: The coffee is strong, very strong, so halving the recipe for a single serving may be a good idea if you aren&#39;t a fan of very strong coffee. This would result in this recipe making two servings, hence the varying serving size."
- "Tip: As I said earlier, you can use chocolate milk for a mocha or you can add just half a teaspoon into your whipped coffee and beat on high to incorporate for a chocolatey, coffee foam."
- "Tip: Putting ice is very common in whipped coffee, but I don&#39;t like the feel very much. It ruins the smooth, velvety coffee and milk, because you suddenly get hit by a cube of ice!"
- "Tip: For those who aren&#39;t a huge fan of such airy coffee, you can give it a quick mix into the milk so that the flavour is mellowed and the texture is more liquid."
