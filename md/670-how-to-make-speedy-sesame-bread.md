I used sesame seeds on top this time (and in the bread) and would do add them to the top again but with the pumpkin seeds in the bread. I&#39;ve also made the keto bread (rolls) a couple of times.

If you want to get really festive, a few years ago I made a rosemary bread wreath (&lt; click on text for link) that can also be a fun and edible table decoration. The sesame definitely gives the bread a wonderful nutty flavor. The honey adds a nice slight sweetness to the bread. I think the bread could have been baked a little longer as the bread was a little doughy towards the center. The recipe doesn&#39;t indicate a baking time w/o bread machine.
