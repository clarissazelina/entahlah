Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, tabboule (vegan). It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Tabbouleh is a Lebanese salad, traditionally made of tomatoes, bulgur, onion, mint and parsley, seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice and salt. I prefer to use quinoa instead of bulgur because is gluten free and I love it so much! Easy Tabbouleh Salad (Vegan) Amount Per Serving.

Tabboule (vegan) is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Tabboule (vegan) is something that I've loved my entire life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tabboule (vegan) using 8 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tabboule (vegan)::

I always find this salad in the prepared food section at the supermarket, as well at any Mediterranean food stand, cart or restaurant, even more so than Fattoush! With a parsley base, this delicious salad combines fresh mint, scallions, tomatoes and bulgur. Tabbouleh salad, Tabbouli, or even Tabouli salad is a dish that&#39;s becoming more and more well-known away from it&#39;s traditional Levantine (Eastern Mediterranean) homelands, and there&#39;s very good reason for that. Made from either couscous or bulgur and seasoned with parsley, tomatoes and a mezze of other flavours, it&#39;s extremely tasty - and quick too.

1. Cut the parsley into small pieces

This gluten-free and vegan quinoa tabouli salad (also spelled tabouleh or tabbouleh) salad is made with healthy, whole grain and high-protein quinoa instead of the bulgur wheat which is traditionally used in tabouli recipes. It&#39;s really a two-in-one: you get a quinoa salad as well as a traditional Middle Eastern tabouli, and all of the ingredients are vegetarian and vegan as well as gluten. I&#39;ve recently been eating a vegan (or at least vegan-friendly) dietary preference and developed a newfound appreciation for tabbouleh! Made the recipe as-is, and it was delicious! My vegan aunt and I completely devoured it.
