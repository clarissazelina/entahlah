Fried rice was originally created as a way to use leftover old rice. To make hibachi rice, use rice you&#39;ve made ahead of time instead of freshly cooked rice. For fried hibachi rice that tastes even more like restaurant-quality, use precooked rice bought at the grocery store. If you are grain-free, you can easily substitute the rice with cauliflower rice. Push vegetables to one side of the skillet, add the eggs to the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary.
