recipeingredient:
- 1 lb 80 or better ground beef
- 1 slice bread I prefer white but really any works
- 1 large egg not beaten
- 1 tblsp onion powder
- 12 tsp garlic powder

- 12 C shredded cheese
- 1 C packed brown sugar
- 12 C ketchup

recipeinstructions:
- "Tear bread into small pieces, add milk and let sit while you continue...also preheat oven to 350 and grease the top of a broiler rack"
- "Prepare the meat: in a big bowl, break up and spread the ground beef"
- "Spread the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce (and if you&#39;re using the bouillon and onions, add those) over the meat --don&#39;t mix yet!"
- "Break the egg in then add the wet bread pieces, any milk too"
- "Using a chopping motion with your hand, combine everything --don&#39;t squish the meat through your fingers, it&#39;ll make the loaf tough"
- "Now add the cheese and make sure it&#39;s all combined -the mixture should be pretty wet and almost loose"

- "Now for the topping...in a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, ketchup and mustard, stir well to remove lumps if any"
- "Spread over the patties, covering the sides too"
- "I like to put a little water in the bottom part of the broiler rack, it makes cleanup easier...or I suppose you could use foil..."
- "Bake at 350 for 25 minutes"
- "Serve with salad, potatoes, pasta..whatever you like!"
- "If you&#39;re going to freeze any leftovers, make sure the patties are room temperature before packing and freezing"
