Hello everybody, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, japanese potato salad. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

The classic Japanese potato salad is made of mashed potato (leaving some chunks behind), sliced cucumbers and carrots, eggs and sometimes hams. The ingredients are not too different from the western version, but flavoring wise, the Japanese version is always seasoned with Japanese mayonnaise and sometimes rice vinegar. Japanese versions of Western dishes, known as yōshoku cuisine, may look like the originals that inspired them, but the flavor is unmistakably Japanese.

Japanese Potato Salad is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions daily. They're fine and they look wonderful. Japanese Potato Salad is something that I've loved my entire life.

Getting potato salad right is no picnic. Too often it lacks the acidity or piquancy needed to cut through the richness of the mayonnaise.

Recipe Pin It While Japan may be famous for sushi, home cooking draws from a broad palette of global flavors. The best recipe for Japanese potato salad comes from Shirley Karasawa of the now-defunct blog, Lovely Lanvin (lucky for us, she&#39;s still very active on Instagram). The fashion-loving Japanese-American home cook, who splits her time between Seattle and Tokyo, has incredible taste in all things, but especially in food. Japanese potato salad falls into the category of yōshoku: Japanized &#34;Western&#34; food. Just as we Americans &#34;Americanize&#34; Japanese food by adding such things as cream cheese and avocado to sushi, for example, Japanese chefs have taken certain European and American dishes and tweaked them to suit their own palates.
