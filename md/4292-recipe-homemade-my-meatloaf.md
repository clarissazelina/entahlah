Very similar to my mom&#39;s meatloaf. Though we use Ritz crackers, a couple eggs and the topping is brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, worcestershire sauce. I do like the comment to wet d oi wn your &#34;crumbs&#34; prior to adding to the meat mix. This is a consolidation of my mom&#39;s recipe and my own touches. Adjust the amounts as you need or to your desires.
