Drive your very own ice cream truck and prepare delicious treats from snow cones to milkshakes to banana splits! Meanwhile, pulse cookies in a food processor until fine crumbs form. Transfer half of crumbs to a plate. Variations on this Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Cake: You can swap out the shortbread cookies for a thin, homemade blondie or a thin white cake layer. Personally, I prefer the crushed cookies as I find frozen cake hard to serve and I skipped the blondie because I wanted to keep it no bake.
