- "Divide crumb mixture between cases, then press in firmly."
- "Chill in the fridge for 15 minutes while you make the filling."
- "In a bowl, mash the banana really well. Add the cream cheese, pineapple.and confectioner&#39;s/icing sugar and mix well."

- "If you used paper cases, you may need to use a butter knife and edge it down the side and pop out the cheesecakes, as the cold butter base will be a bit set on the bottom. It shouldn&#39;t take a lot to loosen them, though, and they certainly won&#39;t get ruined."
