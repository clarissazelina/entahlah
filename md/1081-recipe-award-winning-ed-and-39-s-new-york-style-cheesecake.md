It&#39;s made with cream cheese, eggs, egg yolks and heavy cream or sour cream, to add richness and a smooth consistency. Sometimes it&#39;s flavored with lemon to add freshness. Italian-style New York cheesecake is made without a crust and needs plenty of time to cool. The cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sour cream make it rich and velvety smooth.

This delicious cheesecake is similar to the traditional New York cheesecake, but has a keto twist with an almond meal crust. Crust: In a medium sized bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter and stir until all the crumbs are moistened (can also make the crust in your food processor). All of these ingredients also make New York cheesecake so tall. Standard cheesecake recipes are maybe an inch or two thick, but New York-style is often double that. So yes, cut us a slice.
