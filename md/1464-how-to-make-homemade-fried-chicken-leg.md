Drumsticks have fatty flavors and a delicious firm and dark meat that is great for frying. Most recipes use breast and thigh meat, but if you regularly buy budget-friendly frying chickens and cut them up yourself, save the breast and thigh meat for casseroles, salads, sandwiches, and pie, and use the drumsticks for more casual gatherings like picnics, potlucks, game day parties, or children&#39;s. Don&#39;t cover the chicken until at least halfway through or it will get too soft.
