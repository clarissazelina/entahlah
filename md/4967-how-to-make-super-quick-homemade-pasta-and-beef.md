Ground beef is a great choice for pairing with pasta because it will cook quickly and you don&#39;t have to worry about it getting tough. In a large nonstick frying pan, heat the oil over high heat until hot and shimmering but not smoking. Stir in tomato sauce, tomatoes and mushrooms. Remove from heat; pour into sprayed baking dish. Add the pasta and beef stock, cover the pan with a lid, and leave to cook until the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is cooked.
