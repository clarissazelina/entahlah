This quick-cooking dish features softly scrambled eggs and saut√©ed breakfast sausage and onion. This breakfast skillet is reminiscent of the hashbrown bowl at Waffle House. It&#39;s filling and tastes decadent, but is still a pretty low-calorie breakfast. Be sure to use a large skillet because although it may seem too big for the amount of ingredients, you need the surface area to get your potatoes crispy (overcrowding your skillet will just steam them). Avocado - You can top your bowls with avocados and this varies due to the weight of your avocado.
