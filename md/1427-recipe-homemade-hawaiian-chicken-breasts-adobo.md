Chicken Thighs - Chicken thighs and chicken legs are the two best cuts of chicken to use in this Filipino dish, be sure to use bone in and skin on. I do not recommend using chicken breasts in this recipe. Soy Sauce - I use low sodium soy sauce in all recipes as the sodium in regular soy sauce is just too high and the flavors are too salty in recipe testing. Put chicken in single layer in heavy frying pan just large enough to hold all the chicken. Add chicken skin side down and cook, lifting pieces with tongs once or twice toward the end to let hot fat flow underneath, until fat.
