But honestly, carrot cake is such an incredible dessert and I think it should be enjoyed all year long. Especially when it comes to this carrot cake recipe. I know it can be a bold statement to call a recipe the best, but I truly mean it with this one. While some recipe historians trace the roots of carrot cake back to medieval times, we disagree. We know exactly where the best carrot cakes come from - the oven of a Southerner&#39;s kitchen.
