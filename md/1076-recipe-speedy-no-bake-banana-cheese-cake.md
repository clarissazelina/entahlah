From the smooth and custardy vanilla pudding to the sensational ripe banana slices to the rich. Make cheesecake filling: In a large bowl using a hand mixer or in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat cream cheese until fluffy and no clumps remain. Smooth half of the cheesecake mixture into the tin on top of the biscuit base, then add the banana slices all over. Instead of making from-scratch dough and baking it in the oven, I decide to go with an easy graham cracker crust here.
