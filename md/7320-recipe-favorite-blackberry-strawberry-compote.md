recipeingredient:
- 12 oz blackberries
- 12 oz strawberries cut into 12 pieces
- 34 cups sugar the blackberries were sweet
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 Tablespoon water
recipeinstructions:
- "Stir everything together in a pot and put on medium heat until all the sugar melts. Stir again, lower the heat to just above low and simmer for about 35 to 45 minutes, depending on how large the cooking surface of your cooking vessel. Don&#39;t forget to stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks and burns. If the compote starts sticking, your heat&#39;s too high, and you should adjust it down."
- "Once cooled, you can store it in any covered glass or plastic container. Also, the larger the surface, the less time because your layer is thinner and takes less time to cook. I used a 3.5 quart saucepan today with a roughly 7-inch diameter, and it took 45 minutes."
- "You can add spices like cinnamon, cardamom, clove, or even a little ginger to this if you like. Lemon and orange zest are also delicious. I usually like to make it plain so I can flavor it according to use. Enjoy! :)"

This recipe is from the Williams-Sonoma FRUIT DESSERT cookbook, a copy of which my gracious partner in the current Cookbook Swap sent to me! It is ALWAYS best to use fruits when they are in season, but if making this recipe when they are not, frozen berries COULD be used!. Turn the compote into strawberry rhubarb sorbet. Process in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Scrape in vanilla seeds and add pod, or add lemon zest if using.
