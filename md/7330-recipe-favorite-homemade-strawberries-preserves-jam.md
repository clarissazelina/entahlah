recipeingredient:
- 250 gr strawberries
- 12 cup sugar
-  or ratio 21
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare a plate, put it into freezer for later purpose"
- "Clean and cut the strawberries into dice (cut off the leaves too)"
- "In medium heat, put together the strawberries and 1/4 part of the sugar into the pan."
- "Boil and stir them well until the juice comes out, and the sugar completely melt."
- "Keep stirring and add the rest of the sugar, stir them well until all sugar completely melt."
- "Skim the white bubbles that appear from this process, and let it boils until the texture become thicker and the color become darker. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes."
- "Turn off your stove, and take out the plate from the freezer, put about a drop or 2 drops of the jam&#39;s liquid onto the plate, and chill it into the freezer about 1 minute."
- "Check the texture by touching the liquid after being chilled. If the liquid could get a bit wrinkle and thick after being touch, it means the jam is done, but when you touch it the liquid is too liquidy, it means you need to boil it a bit more, until it becomes thicker than before."
