recipeingredient:
- 12 cup 113 gr unsalted butter
- 12 cup 100 gr granulated white sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 1 tsp cinnamon powder optional
- 2 cups all purpose flour 256 gr
- 12 tsp baking powder
- 12 tsp baking soda
- 14 tsp salt
- 125 ml 1 container strawberry yoghurt
- 12 cup 120 ml toasted almond
- 170 ml strawberry jam
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven into 350°F or 180°C"
- "When preheating oven, you could toast your almond in it about 5-8 minutes or until you could smell the fragrance from the outside of your oven. Chopped them coarsely."
- "Sift together all the dry ingredients such as all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, vanilla essence, cinnamon powder, and salt. Set aside."
- "In the other bowl cream together butter and sugar until fluffy and the color turned pale."
- "Add the eggs one at a time, whisk them until well mixed."
- "Add the dry ingredients by dividing them into 1/3 and alternate them with the yoghurt when pouring them inside the wet batter."
- "Whisk them until all well combined."
- "Add the strawberry jam and the toasted chopped almond into the batter, fold them gently until all combined."
- "Pour the batter inside the container that have already been greased by butter and dusted with flour."
- "Bake about 40-45 minutes or until completely done. If you use a smaller oven or toaster you should pay attention on the temperature. I&#39;ve burnt mine (the top of the bread) when baked it with 350°F or 180°C,. Perhaps the oven that I used was small. If you have the same issue, bake them 350°F /180°C for the first 5 minutes and turn the heat lower into 302°F / 150°C until 325 °F / 160°C afterward."
- "Try to check the bread after 35 minutes with the tooth pick or bamboo skewer. If it comes out clean it means your bread is done. But if it comes out with the wet batter it means you should continue the baking process about 5-10 more minutes."
