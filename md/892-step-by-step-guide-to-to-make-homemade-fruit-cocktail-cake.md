Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, fruit cocktail cake. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Very moist and fruity cake, no oil added, quick and easy. Especially delicious when served with whipped cream. In a large bowl, combine all cake ingredients; mix well.

Fruit Cocktail Cake is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look fantastic. Fruit Cocktail Cake is something that I have loved my entire life.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have fruit cocktail cake using 11 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Fruit Cocktail Cake::

1. Prepare 2 cups self rising flour
1. Get 15 oz fruit cocktail in heavy syrup (undrained)
1. Make ready 2 large eggs
1. Get 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. Prepare 1 1/2 cups sugar
1. Make ready 1 stick butter
1. Prepare 1 cup sweetened coconut flakes
1. Take 1 cup sugar
1. Prepare 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready 1 cup evaporated milk
1. Make ready 1 cup chopped pecans


Add eggs, fruit cocktail and vanilla and mix all ingredients well (by hand--do not use electric mixer); batter will seem very thick at first (if you use good fruit cocktail that has mostly fruit, not all juice), but this is the way it should be (the juice in the fruit cocktail is the only liquid in this recipe. Fruit Cocktail in Syrup: The simple chemistry of this cake just doesn&#39;t work the same way if you use a fruit cocktail in juice. The fruit cocktail in syrup is important! Skip the Box: The reason I don&#39;t use boxed cake mix in my recipe is that with the simplicity of this recipe, a mix doesn&#39;t really seem like convenience at all! 

##### Steps to make Fruit Cocktail Cake:

1. Preheat oven to 350. Spray 9x13 pan.
1. Mix first 5 ingredients until well blended
1. Pour into pan and bake 30-35 minutes.
1. Poke a few holes in cake with a fork.
1. Combine remaining ingredients in a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil for 1 minute.
1. Pour warm sauce over warm cake, spread coconut and pecans evenly.


In a large bowl, combine the first six ingredients; stir until smooth. Combine brown sugar and nuts; sprinkle over top. You could make this with a boxed cake mix. I&#39;m a a big fan of boxed cake mixes, however, with this recipe it is almost easier than a boxed cake mix because there aren&#39;t that many ingredients in the actual cake and this batter is super moist &amp; the flavor of a boxed cake mix won&#39;t compete with the fruit cocktail you are adding to the batter.
