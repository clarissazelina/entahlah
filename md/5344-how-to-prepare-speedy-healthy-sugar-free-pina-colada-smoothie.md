Serve with or without alcohol for a delicious escape to the tropic. There is nothing better than sitting on the beach with a cold Pina Colada in your hand! great recipe but for a lactose friendly version try using nut/soy milk kefir (healthy bacteria) &amp; chilled canned coconut as a substitution for the coconut yogurt and milk. also if you put the liquids in the blender first it helps to keep the blender from getting stuck without having to add more liquids. also adding the frozen fruit slowly will keep the smoothie from becoming too thick too fast.
