recipeingredient:
-  For the batter
- 1 large egg
- 14 cup whipping cream
- 12 cup coconut milk shake the can well before opening to incorporate the fat and cream solids with the liquid
- 12 teaspoon coconut extract
- 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar to tenderize the flour
- 1 Tablespoon sugar
- 23 cup All Purpose flour
- 13 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 12 teaspoon baking soda
- 2 Tablespoons butter melted
-  For the syrup
- 3 Tablespoons coconut milk
- 2 Tablespoons maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 Tablespoon butter
- 12 teaspoon coconut extract
- 1 good pinch of salt
recipeinstructions:
- "In a mixing bowl, combine egg, whipping cream, coconut milk, vanilla extract, vinegar, and sugar for batter and whisk thoroughly until it has a soft pastel yellow color to it."
- "Then add flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and 2 Tablespoons melted butter and whisk or stir again just to combine thoroughly, and until you have a fairly smooth batter."
- "While the batter is resting, make your syrup. Combine all syrup ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat until all the butter and sugar are melted. (Or you can microwave it, first for about 20 seconds, then stir, and then another 10 seconds.) Keep your syrup warm on the lowest possible stove setting, or just zap it for about 15 seconds right before you drizzle it over your pancakes."
- "Griddle your pancakes on a lightly buttered griddle/non-stick pan/cast iron pan/whatever you griddle your pancakes on, preheated to medium, using about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake, flipping when you begin to see little bubbles appear all over the pancake. That usually takes about 3 minutes on the first side, and only about 30 to 45 seconds on the second side to finish."
- "Since this is a small batch of pancakes, you probably won&#39;t have to adjust your heat, but if you&#39;re making a large batch, you do want to manage the heat, adjusting it down just a bit if you find that your pancakes are starting to brown too much before it&#39;s time to flip."
- "Drizzle some of that sweet-salty-nutty-buttery Coconut Maple Syrup over your Coconut Pancakes, close your eyes for a moment so you can inhale that warm sunny feeling of coconuts on a cold winter&#39;s morning, then open &#39;em back up again and ENJOY. :)"

Salt: A small pinch is all you need. Coconut sugar and pure maple syrup are unrefined and your body can break them down effectively unlike the processed white table sugars.

Whisk the eggs in one at a time.
