They are nice and they look wonderful. Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Monkey Bread is something that I have loved my whole life.

Peanut butter is a food paste or spread made from ground, dry-roasted peanuts. It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook peanut butter &amp; chocolate monkey bread using 8 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Monkey Bread::

1. Take 1/2 Cup Granulated Sugar
1. Prepare 1/2 Cup Peanut Butter Powder
1. Get 2 Cans Pillsbury Honey Butter Flaky Layers Biscuits
1. Prepare 1 Tsp Vanilla Extract
1. Make ready 1 &amp; 1/2 Sticks of Butter Melted (12 Tbsp)
1. Get 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar Packed
1. Make ready 1/4 Tsp Kosher Salt

It&#39;s made by removing most of the natural oils from peanuts — a process called defatting — and then grinding the peanuts into a powder. Gradually mix in the sugar, and when it starts to get thick, incorporate milk one tablespoon at a time until all of the sugar is mixed in and the frosting is thick and spreadable. Peanut butter acts as an excellent source of potassium, and potassium can go a long way towards countering the dangers of sodium. A common worry about eating peanut butter is the fat content. 

##### Steps to make Peanut Butter &amp; Chocolate Monkey Bread:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray a 12 cup Bundt pan with cooking spray and set aside.
1. In a small saucepan melt the butter.
1. In a small bowl combine brown sugar, vanilla, and salt.
1. Once butter is melted remove from heat. Stir in the brown sugar, vanilla, and salt until well combined and sugar is dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly while you prepare the rest of the ingredients in the next steps.
1. In a large Ziploc bag combine granulated sugar and peanut butter powder and shake to combine well. I used PB Fit peanut butter powder (this also goes great in pancakes.)
1. Open biscuits. Cut each biscuit into 4 pieces. Place all the biscuit pieces in bag with granulated sugar and peanut butter powder and shake to thoroughly coat each piece. You could do this in a large bowl if you don&#39;t have a bag handy.

1. To turn out place plate or serving tray over pan and carefully flip over. Let it sit for a minute and then slowly remove the pan.


However, as mentioned above peanut butter contains more unsaturated fat than saturated fat. Peanut butter is a delicious spread commonly used in sandwiches, baked goods, candy, and even milkshakes. Making peanut butter at home can help you save money while creating a healthier, tastier snack. Mix the cream cheese, confectioners&#39; sugar and peanut butter together until smooth. Spoon the mixture into the graham cracker crust.
