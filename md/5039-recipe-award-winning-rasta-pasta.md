The name of the dish stems from Rastafarian culture. True Rastafarians do not consume any meat, shellfish, or animal by products such as dairy in their diet, which is why this pasta is typically made vegan. A few people have seen the &#34;Rasta&#34; in the title (short for Rastafarian) and mentioned that this should have no meat. The premise of the dish is not for the contents of the dish but for the colors (red, green and gold). Great spin on pasta it was refreshing trying something different than just the usual pasta covered in sauce.
