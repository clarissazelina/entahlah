- 2 eggs cooked like you want
- 2 cloves garlic chopped
- 12 small onion chopped
- 121 cup any leftover meat cut into pcs
- 12 pcs leftover sausages optional

- to taste Salt
- 1 stalk green onion chopped optional garnish
recipeinstructions:
- "First fry your eggs in your choice of oil or butter, season with salt if desired. I did sunny side ups and let the brown edges remain in the pan. You can also do a scramble and later on cut in pieces and stir in with your rice."
- "Remove the eggs, set aside. Toss in your garlic and onions. Get your leftover meat &amp;/or sausages from the fridge and slice it, throw it in the pan. I used leftover chicken adobo, some hot dogs and fish balls I found in the fridge. Let edges crisp a little. Scrape any sticking to the pan."
- "Left over veggies are good too but don&#39;t use the saucy kind. It&#39;ll make your rice mushy."
- "Get your day old rice from the fridge and crumble it on top of the pan with your hand. Flatten/loosen the balls of rice or clumps with your fingers. Let it sit a few minutes without mixing, to heat it through. Increase the heat a little."
- "Cut up your tomato and drop it into the pan. Season with your favorite soy sauce or liquid seasoning (all areas of the pan). Then now you can mix with your spatula! :) After mixing, let it sit in the heat, to fry/cook the rice."
- "Taste test. Add more seasoning or salt if desired. Mix again and let it sit a couple minutes in the heat again."
- "Mix again and let it sit in the heat again. The rice should now have changed color, meaning you&#39;ve mixed it well. The rice should now be in individual pieces and not clumped together. Use spatula to scrape any sticking to the pan, mix again."
- "If you scrambled your eggs, cut it up and toss in the pan. Mix well and remove from heat. Sprinkle your green onions/chives on top and serve. If not, just serve the rice beside your eggs like what I did. No chives in mine :)"
