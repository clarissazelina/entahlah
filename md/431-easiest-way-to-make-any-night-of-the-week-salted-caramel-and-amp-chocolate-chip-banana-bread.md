Very delicious pouring sauce but not really caramel (flavour or colour), as the recipe doesn&#39;t include a step to caramelize the sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until sugar is dissolved. If granules of sugar become stuck to sides of saucepan, use wet pastry brush to brush granules down towards syrup. To make this salted caramel sauce, you&#39;ll start out with some water and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. One important thing when making homemade caramel sauce is to make sure to use a pan that&#39;s a little bigger than what you think you&#39;ll need.
