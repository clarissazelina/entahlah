Lemons and cherries may be added too, for an additional splash of color. However, any fruity, full bodied, somewhat-dry red Spanish wine will do. *Recipe adapted from a new favorite of mine, Jamie Oliver Drinks Tube. *Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with the lesser amount of brown sugar. The best wine for sangria is Garnacha (also called Grenache) or Pinot Noir. Garnacha comes from Spain, so it&#39;s my top pick for authentic Spanish sangria!
