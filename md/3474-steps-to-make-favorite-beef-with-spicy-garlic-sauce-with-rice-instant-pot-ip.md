In the inner pot of the Instant Pot, combine the minced garlic, the white and light green slices of green onion, beef stock, soy sauce, brown sugar, rice wine vinegar, gochujang sauce, ginger, and ground black pepper. This Instant Pot Mongolian Beef is fabulously sweet and salty with lots of ginger and garlic flavor. The sauce is a wonderful mixture of soy sauce, dark brown sugar, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes. So, I like to have a few great recipes to choose from so things don&#39;t get too redundant. Add sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, honey, chili garlic sauce, chicken, water and rice noodles to Instant Pot in that order, making sure rice noodles are floating a little bit above the liquid.
