- 500 g AllPurpose Flour
- 100 g Caster Sugar
- 150 g butter softened
- 1 egg  1 egg yolk
- 100 g sourdough starter
- 200 ml Whole Milk
- 05 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 drops almond extract
- 2 pinches mixed spice
- 7 g salt
- 200 g raisinscurrantsdried blueberries etc
- 80 g mixed candied peel
- 100 ml cardamom coffee
- 225 g Marzipan
-  melted butter
-  icing sugar
recipeinstructions:
- "Make dough by mixing flour, sugar, starter, butter, egg, milk, vanilla extract, almond extract and mixed spice. Work into a dough and then knead for a bit. Work in the salt and then knead some more. 7 minutes kneading in total."
- "Leave to prove for 5hours at 20C. While it is proving, make a coffee. Not for you - we are going to soak the fruit in it. Ideally you want to make a double espresso with about 8 cardamom pods in it. (crack them, so liquid can get into the pods, but don&#39;t open them so the seeds fall out). Add the cardamom pods while the coffee is still hot, and then leave to sit at room temp for an hour or so."
- "Remove the cardamom pods from the coffee and pour the coffee into a bowl containing the raisins and the mixed peel. Stir occasionally over the course of the next few hours (while the dough is still proving)."
- "Make Marzipan (unless you just bought it)."
- "When the dough has finished proving (it might have doubled in size, don&#39;t worry if it hasn&#39;t quite) drain any excess liquid from the fruit and work it into the dough by doing a series of folds. This becomes quite hard work when there is a lot of fruit. Don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t get it all into the dough."
- "When the fruit is evenly distributed, roll it flat to about 45cm x 35cm. Roll the Marzipan flat to 35cm x 20cm. place the Marzipan on top of the dough and roll it up so that you have a sausage-shaped loaf with a swirl of dough running through the centre. It should be quite big. Don&#39;t worry if there is exposed marzipan sticking out the end. This will turn into the most excellent burnt bits imaginable."
- "Leave to prove for another 2 hours."
- "Bake at 180C for 1 hr."
- "Poke holes in the dough using a cake tester, then melt butter onto the surface and try to work it into the holes. When the Stollen has cooled, dust with icing sugar."

Stollen definition is - a sweet yeast bread of German origin containing fruit and nuts. Chock-full of dried fruit, almonds, and spices, the German stollen is a dense bread that is traditionally oblong, symbolizing a swaddled infant. Christstollen is a rich yeast dough full of raisins, nuts, and candied fruit. A buttery, fruit-filled, sugar-coated loaf, stollen is about as rich and dense as yeast bread can get—and therein is a potential pitfall. Some years I have been disappointed by stollen dough.
