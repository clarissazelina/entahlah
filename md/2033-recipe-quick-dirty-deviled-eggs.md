recipeingredient:
- 2 Dozen large eggs hard boiled
- 2 tbs Baking Soda or Powder
- 1 C Mayonaise
- 23 tbs Yellow Mustard
- 23 tbs Worchestshire sauce
-  Green pimento stuffed olives
- Half jar of olive juice
- 12 tbsp Celery seed
- 1 tsp Cayenne pepper
-  Paprika
recipeinstructions:
- "Hard boil the eggs with 1-2 tbs bakins soda or powder in the water (this helps peel the shells off) once cooked peel, rinse in cold water. Halve the eggs separating the yolk into a bowl and put the whites on trays."
- "Add celery seed and cayenne pepper to yolks. Use a fork to mix together well and crumble up the yolk."
- "Add your mayonnaise (a bit at a time so as to not overdo it), then add Worchestshire sauce, yellow mustard and mix. Now it will be thick...you now pour in the olive juice from the jar of Olive to thin it out. Use adding bits more of mayo and even a few more dashes of Worchestshire sauce, mustard etc. to keep the mixture taste on point until the desired consistency is reached. The key to this &#34;dirty&#34; recipe is the olive juice being prominent (think dirty martini)"
- "Once the yolk is the consistancy you desire put into halved egg whites. I use a melon baller but to each their own. Once done you then take the olives and cut them in half. You put one half an olive on top of the yolk if each egg. Sprinkle with paprika and serve! (We tend to go a bit heavy on the paprika)"
