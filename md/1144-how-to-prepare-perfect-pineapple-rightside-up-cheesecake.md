Add vegetable oil, almonds, eggs, vanilla, and drained pineapple. Turn off oven and leave door ajar. Upside down, right side up…there&#39;s no wrong way to enjoy this Southern-favorite cake. It gets baked with a base of ooey gooey pineapple slices, which become sticky and sweet during their time in the oven. When it&#39;s finished baking, the cake gets inverted in one big flip so that the pineapple rounds end up topping the cake and displayed upside down—or right side up, depending on your.
