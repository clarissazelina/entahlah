After times up, turn off the heat, but leave the lid on for another 5 minutes. Then fluff the quinoa with a fork and set it aside."

Then stir in the broth, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce and seasonings. Increase the heat to medium-high."
- "Once it starts to come to a low boil, add in the beans and sweet potatoes. Let this simmer until the sweet potatoes are tender, which will depend on how big you diced them. Once they are tender, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cooked quinoa and the corn. Serve with whatever toppings sound good."

Once it&#39;s boiling, stir in the quinoa, place the lid on, lower the heat to medium-low and let it cook for 15 minutes. After times up, turn off the heat, but leave the lid on for another 5 minutes. Then fluff the quinoa with a fork and set it aside.

Once they are tender, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cooked quinoa and the corn. Serve with whatever toppings sound good.


Quinoa - Quinoa, technically a seed, not a grain, is the perfect addition since it cooks in the same amount of time as it takes to simmer the chili. These tiny seeds are packed with protein, vitamins and minerals to give this easy vegetarian chile a hearty (no pun intended!) nutrient boost. Fry the onion, garlic and red chilli in a spray of olive oil until soft, then add the spices, including chilli powder if you like it spicy. Tip in the quinoa, stock, tomatoes and black beans, and season well. Once chili is done cooking, stir in additional cup of vegetable broth.
