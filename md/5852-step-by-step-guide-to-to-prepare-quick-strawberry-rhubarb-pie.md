You can substitute a plain top crust instead of the lattice top if you like; brush with the egg glaze and cut steam vents. Tip: Keep a clear plastic quilt ruler with your baking and cooking supplies to measure pastry strips for lattice. While being raised on a farm I often ate rhubarb, so it&#39;s natural for me to use it in a pie. I prefer to use lard for the flaky pie crust and thin, red rhubarb stalks for the filling. Mix sugar and tapioca together and fold gently into the strawberries and rhubarb.
