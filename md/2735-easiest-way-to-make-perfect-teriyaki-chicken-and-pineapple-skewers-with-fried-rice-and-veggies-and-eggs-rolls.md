These are made with a teriyaki glaze that&#39;s flavorful simple and easily adaptable to any grilled or bbq recipe. First of all, you can use the glaze on roasted chicken, meats and other veggies. Put simply, it all boils down to the age of the cooked rice … Freshly made rice = sticky, glue-like fried rice; Day-old rice = perfectly plumped, clump-free fried rice; The key element in this equation is the moisture level. Hot, fresh rice sticks together, while older, cooler rice is less likely to cling to itself. I did not marinate the pineapples with the raw chicken (that didn&#39;t seem safe to me).
