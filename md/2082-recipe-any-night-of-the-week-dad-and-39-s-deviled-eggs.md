recipeingredient:
- 1 Hard boiled eggs chilled
- 1 Mayonnaise
- 1 Mustard
- 1 Horseradish
- 1 salt  pepper to taste
- 1 garlic powder to taste
- 1 minced chives
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the eggs and cut them in half long ways."
- "Pop the yolks out into a small mixing bowl and smash them up with a fork.  Stir in a bit of salt, pepper and garlic pepper.  Just a little; you can add more later."
- "Squirt in some mustard and stir to distribute."
- "Add some horseradish and stir.  Again, go easy.  You can add more, if necessary, after the next step."
- "Now add the mayonnaise and stir well to combine all the ingredients.  Unfortunately, in case you&#39;re looking at the photos for approximate amounts to use, I didn&#39;t follow my own advice, and I put in too much mayo.  The mixture was too loose when I stirred it up.  (It was late, I was tired.). So I had to boil more eggs and add those yolks to the mix.  Don&#39;t repeat my mistake.  It&#39;s a drag."
- "Taste for seasoning.  Add more seasoning and/or horseradish, a little at a time, to your own preference."
- "Spoon or pipe the filling into the egg whites and sprinkle with minced chives.  I also like to top them with black olive halves, but I had none on hand.  Store in a covered container in the refrigerator."
