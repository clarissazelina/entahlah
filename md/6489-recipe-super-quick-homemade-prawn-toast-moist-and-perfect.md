recipeingredient:
- 6 Slices bread
- 150 Gr Deveined Tailless Prawns  fresh if possible but frozen works
- 1 egg
- 1 Chilli
- 25 Cm Fresh Ginger or 2 Tsp puree
- 1 Glove Garlic
- 1 Dash Light Soy Sauce
- 1 Dash Sesame Seed Oil
-  Rice Flour  add so mixture not to wet will need a little more if frozen prawns
-  Veg or Sunflower Oil for Frying
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the prawns, garlic, ginger, onions and chilli and stick the lot in a food processor with the egg, soy and sesame oil. Pulse a few times until you have a lumpy paste (NOT a puree) - add some flour and stir in if too wet. Do not keep pulse or you end up with a runny mess."
- "Spread the mixture over the bread equally, then Cut across corner to corner to make triangles. I also trim off the crusts (but this is just a waste lol)."
- "Put sesame seeds into a bowl put prawn mixture side down, into the seeds to stick. Give a little push down to make sure plenty stick."
- "Heat up the oil and carefully place them in the hot oil, sesame side down. Leave them for about 3 minutes or until golden brown, before carefully flipping them over in the oil for another minute or so to brown the other side. I do about 3 - 4 triangles at a time. Drain on Kitchen paper."
- "Transfer to a baking sheet in a warm oven if need to keep hot for a few minutes before serving but the faster the better."
- "Serve with a little honey or sweet chilli sauce."
