A sourdough that has been fed (as wehn mixed into a final bread dough) has only so much capacity to rise, as once the food goes there is no more gas to be produced. Most recipes allows for the dough to be mixed, then for there to be some proportion of the time before baking allowing an initial, partial rise (the &#34;bulk ferment&#34;). To create that steam, you&#39;ll need to preheat a metal rimmed baking pan under the baking sheet as well. Just after you transfer the dough (parchment paper and all) to the hot baking sheet, pour some hot water into the rimmed pan and shut the oven door as quickly as possible. Plain sourdough flatbread is great on its own but feel free to add additional herbs and spices for even more flavor.
