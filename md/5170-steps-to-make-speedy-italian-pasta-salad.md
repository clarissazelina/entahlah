It is called Italian pasta salad because it uses Italian dressing, not because it is a traditional Italian pasta. &#34;Italian&#34; pasta salad is very much an American dish. While I can not speak for other pasta salads, this pasta salad, in the right proportions, can be a great healthy choice. The veggies match the colors in the tri-colored pasta. And the dressing is real zesty and spicy. So when all three - pasta, veggies and dressing - come together, you have a festive, tasty and beautiful salad for six.
