I used this muffin pan to make them, but any large round muffin pan will work just as well!. The key to success is to A) not make the ham layer too thick, and B) use medium or large (NOT extra large) eggs - otherwise, there will be too much white and they will overflow. Line each cup with a slice of ham and sprinkle with cheddar. Crack an egg into each ham cup and season with salt and pepper.
