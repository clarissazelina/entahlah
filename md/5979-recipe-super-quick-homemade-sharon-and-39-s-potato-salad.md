When potatoes are tender drain and place in bowl; set aside.. I like to whisk my dressing in a large bowl that I can make the whole potato salad in (less bowls to wash later). Combine cooled potatoes, eggs, onion, celery, pickles, and bacon. Includes your choice of coleslaw, potato salad, garden salad, jalapeno corn, homemade bread or cornbread Side.
