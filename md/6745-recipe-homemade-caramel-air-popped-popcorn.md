Hey everyone, it's Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, caramel air popped popcorn. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

I used to make Amish Caramel Corn from this site until I ran out of light corn syrup. This recipe used dark corn syrup so I tried it out and it was great. The liquid foams a bit in the oven which really helps with coating the popcorn.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook caramel air popped popcorn using 7 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Caramel Air Popped Popcorn::

1. Take 6-8 cups air popped popcorn
1. Prepare 1 1/4 cup tightly packed brown sugar
1. Get 1/4 cup light corn syrup
1. Prepare 1/4 cup unsalted butter
1. Get 1/2 tsp salt
1. Take 2 tsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready 1/4 tsp baking soda


I usually use light corn syrup. I&#39;ve always placed all the popcorn in the bag, poured the caramel sauce over it and shaken well before placing it in the microwave. Turn the popcorn maker on to begin popping. Once the last kernel has popped, turn the unit off. 

##### Steps to make Caramel Air Popped Popcorn:

1. Place parchment paper in a 13x9 pan. Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
1. Over low heat in a small saucepan, add the brown sugar, corn syrup and butter. Stir together until the butter has melted.
1. Increase the heat to medium and allow to simmer for about 4 minutes.
1. Remove from heat and add the salt &amp; vanilla extract. Stir together.
1. Mix together as you put the baking soda into the pan. Make sure that it is evenly spread.
1. Coat the popcorn with the caramel sauce; stirring together to evenly coat the popcorn.
1. Place the caramel popcorn into the pre-heated oven for about 15 minutes. Place the popcorn back into the oven, after stirring, to heat for another 15 minutes. Remove to stir, then place back into oven 15 minutes. Take out the oven, stir and allow to cool off. Break up any clumps.

Drizzle the caramel sauce on top of the popped corn and mix to fully coat. The popcorn still tasted healthy and light, similar to air-popped despite the fact that it&#39;s in a microwaveable bag. The pieces were firm and flavorful. Cons: It only comes in mini-sized bags, which can be difficult to pop without burningâ€”and will leave you with less than the ideal amount of popcorn in the end. Caramel corn starts with popped corn, of course!
