Hello everybody, it's Brad, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, baked potato. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Baked Potato is only one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. Baked Potato is something that I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

The perfect baked potato is crispy on the outside and pillowy in the middle. Cracked open and still steaming, it&#39;s ready to receive anything from a sprinkle of cheese to last night&#39;s stew. Baking a potato in the oven does require a little more time than zapping it in the microwave, but it&#39;s mostly hands-off time.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have baked potato using 5 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Baked Potato::

1. Get 1 potato
1. Take  Season salt
1. Take  Pepper
1. Prepare  Chile powder
1. Take 1 tsp shredded cheese


Or at least a good hour and a half. Then the KEY to my famous baked potatoes is this: *After removing from the oven take each one and squish it a bit by lightly squeezing it between a towel because they are so hot! The result is the potato becomes crumbly and fluffy and then lather on the toppings! In its essence, a baked potato is a potato, baked. 

##### Instructions to make Baked Potato:

1. Use a fork and poke around potato 4xs
1. Pop in microwave for 2-3 min. Till soft
1. Scoop out center making a bowl

1. Put potato mixture back in potato and spinkle with chile powder
1. Optional You can top with green onions bacon bits too with a dollop of sour cream


As with all elemental things, though, the simplicity of a baked potato is deceptive. We&#39;ve all had excellent baked potatoes and terrible baked potatoes. Happily, an excellent one is not any harder to make than a terrible one. The right potato, the right temperature, and the right timing are key. Any potato can be baked, but for the perfect baked potato with the desired flaky texture, it is recommended that mature, baking-type potatoes such as the Russet potatoes be used.
