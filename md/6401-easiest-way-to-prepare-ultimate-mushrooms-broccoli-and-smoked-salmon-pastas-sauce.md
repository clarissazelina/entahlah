Smoked Salmon, Pea and Broccoli Pasta - this delicious, lemony, nourishing pasta sauce I most often serve with quinoa and rice pasta or noodles.. Break the salmon into chunks and add to the peas/broccoli sauce. When the pasta is al dente, strain (rinse if necessary) and gently fold through the sauce.. Cook the pasta according to the packet. Once boiling, heat the butter and oil and fry the garlic for a couple of minutes.
