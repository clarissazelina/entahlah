recipeingredient:
- 12 cup chickpea flour also known as gram flour besan or kabab
- 12 cup water
- 12 teaspoon sea salt
-  Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
-  Spray oil to coat the pan
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium bowl combine the chickpea flour, water, salt, pepper and olive oil. Whisk with a fork until a medium thick batter forms. You don&#39;t want it to be too watery, but it shouldn&#39;t be too thick either. Depending on your brand of chickpea flour you may have to adjust and add in more water, but do so one tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached."
- "Lightly spray the pan with oil and allow to heat on a medium flame before adding in half the batter. Swirl it around slightly to spread and cook on low heat until the edges start to brown and the top has firmed up, roughly 3 minutes. Flip over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Repeat for the remainder of the batter."
- "Tip: These are meal prep friendly - you can definitely double or triple the batch and make extra to freeze and use later as you would normal flatbread throughout the week. They re-heat brilliantly. Adding a pinch of herbs de provence (or whatever herbs you like) is a great way to spice up the base. You can make this without the added oil in the batter if you so wish, but definitely make sure you’re using a non-stick or ceramic pan otherwise things will get a bit messy!"
