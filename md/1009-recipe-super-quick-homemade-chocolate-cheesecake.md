It is creamy and rich…almost like a dense chocolate mousse, but BETTER!

I substituted raspberry liquor for the vanilla extract and swirled raspberry preserves over the chocolate ganache, along with a drizzle of white chocolate. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the pan, drizzle melted fudge around the edge and decorate with halved mini Reese&#39;s peanut butter cups and Reese&#39;s Pieces. To make the filling: Combine the milk and chocolate chips in a small saucepan or microwave-safe bowl or large cup. Heat, stirring frequently, until the chips melt and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat, stir in the espresso powder, and set the mixture aside.
