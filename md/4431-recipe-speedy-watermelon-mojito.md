Read Customer Reviews &amp; Find Best Sellers. Fresh watermelon, mint, and white rum star in this delicious and refreshing mojito recipe that makes a perfect drink for summertime parties and BBQs. Muddle until the sugar dissolves and the mint leaves are bruised but still intact.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook watermelon mojito🍉🍉 using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Watermelon Mojito🍉🍉::

1. Get 1 cup watermelon (cubes)
1. Take 3 tbs lemon juice
1. Take 1 lemon sliced
1. Take cubes Few frozen watermelon

Add a few diced watermelon if desired and garnish each glass with mint and a thin slice of watermelon. My Watermelon Mojito recipe is a bit different from others because you muddle the the melon directly in the glass rather than puree the watermelon separately and add it to the cocktail. Less effort, less dishes but still the same great flavor. Start with a tall collins (or highball) glass. This helps to release the mint flavor from the leaves, resulting in a fresher tasting watermelon mojito!
