You cannot tell the mayonnaise is in it. Since mayonnaise is made with eggs and oil, there is no need to add oil to this recipe and it uses less eggs. The classic chocolate mayonnaise cake was born during the Great Depression when many fresh ingredients were harder to come by and also harder to afford for cakes. Mayonnaise is made from two main ingredients - oil and eggs. So, thus the mayonnaise cake was born using mayonnaise in place of the eggs and oil in the chocolate cake recipe.
