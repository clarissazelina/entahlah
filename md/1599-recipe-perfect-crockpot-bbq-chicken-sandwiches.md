Cooking Tips for CrockPot BBQ Chicken. If you have time, make my homemade BBQ sauce recipe to use in this crockpot recipe. You can mix up the ingredients for the BBQ sauce right in your slow cooker. You don&#39;t need to simmer the BBQ sauce on the stove since the flavors will have plenty of time to blend as the BBQ sauce cooks with the chicken in the slow cooker. I used hawaiin [maybe sweet? or tangy?] bbq sauce, it made the shredded chicken even better! just that lil extra taste to it….tho i cheated and used canned shredded chicken….first time with this new one on sale with lemon pepper….and ? something else….man hubby loved the sandwiches! tasted good plain on plate too… Add sliced onions to slow cooker and place the chicken on top.
