The classic moist pumpkin bread from Down East is spiced with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. This bread improves with age, so plan to make it a day ahead if possible. Pumpkin bread should always have a handful of things: a mixture of fall spices, some kind of oil in the batter, and pure pumpkin puree. We&#39;ve tested different ratios of spices and landed on a blend of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to perfume the flour before it&#39;s whisked into the wet ingredients.

Pumpkin Bread gets better with time, so whip it up a day or so in advance before you plan on eating it or giving it. Because let me tell you, it makes a great gift for neighbors, a hostess gift, or a gift for your boss if you&#39;re looking to butter them up a bit. This is a seriously easy pumpkin bread recipe. Pumpkin bread is naturally dense and being able to cream the butter with the sugar and eggs to add air and rise lends a more tender crumb than a bread made with oil. I really wasn&#39;t a fan of the oil versions.
