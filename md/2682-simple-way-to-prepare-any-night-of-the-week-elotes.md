The Daily Meal provides a good example. The corn is either held by the husks or mounted on a stick and eaten without utensils. The word elote is actually of Nahuatl origin and simply means &#34;corn on the cob.&#34; This is the best way to serve corn, period. These elotes are grilled until charred and nutty; slathered with a creamy sauce seasoned with garlic, chili powder, crema, cilantro, and Cotija cheese; and served with a coating of extra Cotija cheese and a squeeze of lime. They&#39;ll disappear from your next picnic table faster than you can grill &#39;em.
