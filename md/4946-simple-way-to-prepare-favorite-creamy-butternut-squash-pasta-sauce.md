This Creamy One Pot Butternut Squash Pasta is the perfect restaurant-quality pasta dish that&#39;s so easy to make at home! Butternut squash gets roasted, purÃ©ed, then tossed with Parmesan to make this nutty, creamy pasta sauce Each serving is topped with crispy fried sage leaves, a hint of lemon zest, and toasted walnuts, adding a crunchy contrast to the squash On busy weeknights, feel free to forgo wrestling with a giant squash and use a package of cubed precut squash instead.
