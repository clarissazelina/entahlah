- 1015 ears corn fresh is best canned frozen will work
- 810 Cucumbers roughly peeled and diced

- 1 large red pepper diced
- 1 large green pepper diced
- 12 Onion diced
- 2 cloves garlic minced

recipeinstructions:
- "Get all your ingredients together, and use the counts and measurements in my ingredients list above loosely. If you have more corn or less cucumbers its still a salad :)"
- "If you are using fresh corn go ahead and blanch it for 5 minutes in boiling salted water, remove from pot to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. After the corn has cooled cut the kernels from the cob using the old bunt cake pan method."
- "Then you peel, chop, dice all the veggies you are using. Place in a giant bowl and stir. I roughly peel my home grown cucumbers but if you are using store bought with the wax coating you are going to want to remove all the peeling."
- "Put together dressing ingredients or use any store bought vinaigrette style dressing you want. If you are going to eat this all week (as I plan to) avoid adding salt until serving as it will pull moisture from the veggies and all the extra juice ruins the fresh taste. Also store in a flat cassarole style dish to prevent all those juices congregating at the bottom and ruining your presentation. I hope you enjoy!"
