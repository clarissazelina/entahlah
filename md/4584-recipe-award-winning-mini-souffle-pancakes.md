- "Add the egg yolk or 1 tsp of egg replacer powder mixed with 1 tsp of water into the stiff meringue and continue to mix till it turns into this pale and fluffy mixture. Gradually, add the vanilla extract at this point. Any flavor or extract can be substituted with vanilla such as banana, strawberry or almond. The choices are endless. To make this chocolate-flavored, there are 2 ways but that&#39;s optional... use either melted chocolate or cocoa powder if you want your pancakes to be chocolate flavor"
- "Add 3 tbsp of self-raising flour and 1/2 tsp of baking powder into the pale, fluffy mixture and keep stirring, let all the air incorporate into the pancake batter. At this point, you can dye the pancake batter with edible food color if you&#39;re using fruit-flavored extracts instead of vanilla... you have 2 choices...1 tsp of liquid food dye by Foster Clark&#39;s or 2 to 3 drops of gel food dye by Wilton. If you want to turn this into a funfetti pancake, add the rainbow sprinkles into the batter."
- "Use a ladle to measure the precise amount. Get a clean dry frying pan, rub it with either butter, sunflower margarine, vegetable oil or vegetable shortening and start cooking these for 2 to 3 minutes each for both sides till they&#39;re perfectly done! Use the spatula to flip these pancakes."
