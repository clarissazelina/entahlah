I totally love baking and baking a real good banana bread was on my wish list for long. Do not be misled by the word &#39;bread&#39;. This one is actually a cake but because it is baked in a loaf pan it takes on the title of &#39;bread&#39;. All these, of course, went to the food bank. The following days we followed up with loaves and loaves of banana bread (Mmmmm. . . so good!), and pans of appalachian bread pudding, carrot squash soup, spaghetti, pulled pork, and tomato rice chick soup.
