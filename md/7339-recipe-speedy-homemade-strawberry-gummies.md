recipeingredient:
- 2 cups strawberries washed and leaves discarded
- 23 tbsp honey
- 3 packets Knox unflavored gelatin
recipeinstructions:
- "Just 3 simple ingredients to make yummy strawberry gummies."
- "This is just a picture of the molds I used, purchased from Amazon. If you don&#39;t have silicones molds though, that&#39;s fine! See step 5."
- "Start by throwing the strawberries into a food processor and blending until they turn into a liquid puree. You&#39;ll then want to strain out the seeds. You can use a fine mesh sieve or a nut milk bag to do this. You should end up with 1 cup strained puree."
- "Place your 1 cup puree in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the honey (start with 2 tbsp, then add more to taste of needed) and gelatin until smooth and the mixture begins to simmer. Then remove from heat."
- "Now, it&#39;s time to fill the silicone molds. If you don&#39;t have silicone molds, you can pour the gummy mix onto a small baking tray that&#39;s been lightly sprayed with non-stick spray. Place the baking tray in the fridge for at least 1 hour for it to set and then either cut into small cubes or use a small cookie cutter for fun shapes."
- "If you do have the silicone molds, place them onto a baking tray so they can be moved easily. Use a dropper or a small spoon to fill each cavity with the gummy mixture until it&#39;s all used up."
- "Refrigerate for at least 1 hour for them to set, then just pop them out of the molds."
- "That&#39;s it! Enjoy! Store them in the fridge."
