Zaatar Bread is the English name. The flatbread is better known by various names. Man&#39;ousheh is the single form for one zaatar bread and manakish the plural.

Zaater bread is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They're nice and they look fantastic. Zaater bread is something that I have loved my entire life.


To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have zaater bread using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Zaater bread::

1. Get 1 cup flour
1. Prepare 1 teaspoon baking powder
1. Take 3/4 cup yogurt
1. Take 5 tablespoon zaater
1. Prepare 3 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil


Labneh (strained yogurt) Fresh tomatoes, sliced. The first time I tried the za&#39;atar man&#39;ouche was in a Lebanese restaurant in Brussels. It was long time ago during a trip I took with my mum to Belgium, and that was the first time I tried Lebanese food. Za&#39;atar is a Middle Eastern spice made from a blend of sesame seeds, thyme, salt and dried sumac. 

##### Instructions to make Zaater bread:

Some za&#39;atar blends will have cumin or oregano in it as well. For its minimal ingredients, za&#39;atar has a massive flavour to it, which is slightly salty, and slightly crunchy thanks to the sesame seeds. Mix the zaatar and olive oil in a bowl and set aside. I&#39;ll take any excuse to make something bread-y that I can dunk into a smooth velvety hummus. I&#39;ll also take any excuse to smother za&#39;atar and olive oil over flatbread.
