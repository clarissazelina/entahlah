Salmon with veg is only one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Salmon with veg is something which I've loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

In this recipe, I used multicolored peppers, zucchini, and onion. Put all the cut vegetables on the baking sheet and add some amount of prepared spice mix (reserve some for salmon) and olive oil. Then thoroughly mix vegetables to coat the spices and oil evenly.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook salmon with veg using 7 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Salmon with veg::

1. Get 1 small potatoe

1. Prepare 6 pcs Mushrooms bout
1. Take 250 grms salmon
1. Prepare  Black pepper
1. Prepare  Salt,cumin powder, little lemon
1. Make ready leaves Chop coriander


Cooking salmon in foil makes a moist piece of fish. Then, take the tray with the salmon out of the fridge, pour the marinade into a seperate container and set it to the side, and then add the vegetables, leek, and oil. The marinade will brown the fish as it bakes. The best side dishes for salmon should be simple enough to make while the salmon cooks, and deliver plenty of flavor without outshining or overpowering the beautiful fish. 

##### Steps to make Salmon with veg:

We think basics like rice, vegetables, or salad work well with salmon. In summer, when vegetable options abound, look to sweet ingredients with a sharp edge, like a quinoa and vegetable mix tossed in olive oil and red wine vinegar. There&#39;s also a lot to be said for salmon and corn. Regular grilled corn will do just fine, but I tend to find it to be a little too much sweet-on-sweet. Rinse and pat dry salmon filets.
