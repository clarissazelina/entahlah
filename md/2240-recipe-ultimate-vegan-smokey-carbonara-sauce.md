Vegan Carbonara Sauce To get the &#34;egg-yness&#34; just right in this recipe I&#39;ve used chickpea flour and added so-called black salt to it. This black salt is also called &#39;Kala Namak&#39; and it&#39;s got a slightly sulphurous flavour to it, which makes it taste deliciously egg-y. A classic carbonara recipe usually has bacon or pancetta in it, and an egg sauce that is poured over the top. So we decided to use mushrooms to replace the bacon and to use the &#39;eggy&#39; sauce from our vegan tofu scramble along with some cashews (for thickening) to create the egg effect for the sauce. Smoky marinated cremini mushrooms and peas are tossed with spaghetti in a silky tofu and cashew sauce to create this decadently delicious vegan carbonara.
