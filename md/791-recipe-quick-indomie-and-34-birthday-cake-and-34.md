Indomie Birthday Cake I saw a cake made out of instant noodles, so naturally, I thought I should make one of my own. Originally from Indonesia, these cakes are made with popular instant noodle brand Indomie Mi Goreng. William sendiri mengatakan bahwa untuk bisa membuat birthday cake unik tersebut diperlukan paling tidak puluhan bungkus indomie goreng untuk membuat satu kue. So, you know that Indonesians love Indomie with a fanatical, nearly nationalistic passion, and have come up with all sorts of crazy and inventive ways to enjoy the instant noodle brand&#39;s products, from Indomie burgers and pizzas to the disturbing genius of the Indomie birthday cake. But Indomie innovation does not take place in just Indonesia. &lt;p&gt;BEST Carrot Cake.
