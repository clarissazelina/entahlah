Hello everybody, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, salmon burgers. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Salmon Burgers is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look fantastic. Salmon Burgers is something which I've loved my whole life.

For this recipe, you&#39;ll want to grind part of the salmon in a food processor: It&#39;ll bind the rest, which can be coarsely chopped to retain moisture during cooking Some bread crumbs keep the burger from becoming as densely packed as (bad) meatloaf This approach, along with a few simple seasonings, produces delicious burgers in not much more time than it takes to make one from ground chuck These salmon burgers had a really good flavor and they were quick, easy and inexpensive to make. I added a little more dijon and an extra egg to bump up the flavor and help them stick together a little more. Check out this great salmon burger recipe as well as other burger alternatives.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook salmon burgers using 18 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Salmon Burgers::

1. Get 1 can salmon, around 14oz
1. Make ready 1 jumbo egg
1. Make ready 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
1. Take 1 tbsp fresh or dried herbs (parsley or dill or chive or etc)
1. Make ready 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1. Get 1 tsp salt
1. Make ready 2 tsp onion powder or 1/4 cup chopped onions
1. Take 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
1. Make ready A few generous grinds of freshly cracked pepper
1. Get 1 chopped scallion
1. Take  Serving options
1. Get  Lemon wedges
1. Get  Smoked paprika
1. Get  Shredded cabbage
1. Prepare  Cherry tomatoes
1. Make ready  Avocado
1. Prepare  Tartar sauce

Stir in remaining ingredients except oil. Many salmon burger recipes use canned salmon, but since the salmon is the star of this dish, we found that it was well worth the additional modest expense and effort required to make our burgers with fresh salmon. Burgers made with canned salmon were lackluster (to say the least) and mushy, while those made with fresh salmon were moist and full. For the burgers: Combine all of the salmon burger ingredients, except the coconut oil, in a large bowl and mix well. 

##### Instructions to make Salmon Burgers:

1. Drain the canned salmon, reserving the liquid.
1. Beat the egg in a bowl. Use a fork to mix in the salmon and all the rest of the ingredients with the egg.
1. Form patties. I usually do ones about 3-4in wide and 1/2in thick but you can do whatever size you like. If the mix is feeling too dry and won&#39;t stick together into patties, add some of the reserved salmon liquid to moisten.
1. Fry patties in oil over medium to medium-high heat till they are nice and crispy and browned on both sides.
1. Serve with your choice of dressings.


Patties easily fall apart until they are cooked. Heat coconut oil on a griddle or pan to medium-high heat. Salmon burgers are one of those foods that always seem like they should taste better than they do. In my mind, I picture a delicate yet fatty fish patty, seasoned well, with a lightly seared crust and a tender and juicy medium-rare center. What I tend to get at restaurants is an overly firm and rubbery puck that&#39;s both dry and bland.
