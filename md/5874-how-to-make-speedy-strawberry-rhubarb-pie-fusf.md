Remove from processor bowl and pat out on a floured board. Cut into two pieces and wrap each in plastic wrap. I measured the ingredients I used so you can replicate this recipe exactly, but it&#39;s truly forgiving. You could use more strawberries, or more rhubarb - you only need enough fruit to fill the pie, enough sugar to please your palate, and enough flour to cope with the juiciness of the fruit. In a large bowl, mix together rhubarb, strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, zest, and salt until.
