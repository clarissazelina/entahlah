This three bean chili freezes really well so it makes for a quick dinner on busy days.

Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large wide pot over medium-high heat. Today I am sharing Three Bean Chili with you. 

##### Steps to make Three Bean Chili:

1. In a large pot (4 to 5 quart works), bring oil up to medium temp, add onions, peppers, and garlic, and sweat the aromatics until onions turn translucent (about 4 or 5 minutes).
1. Add tomato paste, chili powder, cumin, black pepper, and bay leaf.
1. Stir to incorporate and let the tomato paste caramelize for about a minute or so.
1. Stir in liquid.

1. Turn heat to low and cook with lid askew for another 20 minutes, adjusting seasoning halfway. Leaving the lid askew lets the steam evaporate, the flavors concentrate, and the chili will thicken a bit.
1. All done! Enjoy with toppings of choice.


It&#39;s an easy, but tasty recipe spiced up with jalapeno pepper and cayenne pepper. A touch of brown sugar tones down the acidity of the tomatoes. I&#39;ve used kidney beans, black beans, and chickpeas but you can use any type of canned beans that you have on hand. A tomato sauce base is flavored with garlic, diced jalapenos, chipotle and ancho chili powders, and cumin. Next come the three beans: canned black, pinto, and red kidney beans.
