Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, gooey banana bread. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Just a few tips to making banana bread. If it is still gooey in the middle, just put some tinfoil on top, it will continue to cook and the crust won&#39;t get too dark. Does anyone know what leaving it to sit for an hour actually does?

Gooey Banana Bread is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look wonderful. Gooey Banana Bread is something that I have loved my entire life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook gooey banana bread using 9 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Gooey Banana Bread::

1. Make ready 3-4 bananas
1. Take 1/3 cup melted butter
1. Get 1 cup sugar
1. Take 1 egg (beaten)
1. Prepare 1 tsp Vanilla
1. Get 1 tsp baking soda
1. Prepare Pinch salt
1. Make ready 1-1/2 cups flour
1. Take  Optional 1/4 cup nuts, raisins or chocolate chips


There are several possible causes for wet banana bread. It could be cooked unevenly, have too little flour or too much fruit, or merely be. Have you ever cut open a loaf of banana bread (or any quick bread, for that matter), and found, to your great chagrin, a sphere of gooey, uncooked batter in the center? You sigh; you salvage both ends of the loaf. 

##### Steps to make Gooey Banana Bread:

1. Preheat your oven to 350. In a bowl, mash the bananas first and then add melted butter.
1. In the same bowl, mix in sugar, vanilla and the beaten egg
1. Again, in the same bowl, mix in baking soda and the pinch of salt.
1. Lastly, mix in the flour and decide whether you want to add an optional ingredient.
1. I used a bread pan, which I greased with butter, (Which you probably do not have to do) and scooped in all the batter. Cook at 350 in the oven for 1 hour.


But there&#39;s no choice except to cut the heart out of your bread (literally!), and throw it away. If your bread is turning out still gooey in the middle, check your oven&#39;s temperature to ensure that your oven is getting hot enough. Use an oven thermometer to check the oven temperature. If you find your oven is running cooler than expected. Combine bananas, flour, sugar, butter, vanilla, bicarbonate of soda and egg.
