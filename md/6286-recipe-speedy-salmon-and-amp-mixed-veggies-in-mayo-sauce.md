Salmon fillets are baked with a lemony raspberry-ginger glaze just until tender, then broiled until browned for a sweet and tangy main dish with wonderful color and flavor. A wonderfully simple recipe for baked salmon. The flavors of lemon and dill really complement the fish. It takes to all types of cooking methods -- grilling, pan-frying, roasting, poaching. It&#39;s equally delicious dressed in flavorful sauces or unadorned, simply prepared on the grill or in the pan with a little olive oil and salt.
