I love salmon paired with a creamy sauce and this dill sauce is my favorite. Dill Sauce is refreshing, rather than heavy as many &#34;creamy&#34; sauces can be, because it is made with sour cream. The slight acidity is a great pairing with salmon or trout which are quite rich and oily. Skillet salmon with lemon and dill cream sauce - delectable, creamy, delicious. Pair it with shell pasta, and you have a match made in heaven!
