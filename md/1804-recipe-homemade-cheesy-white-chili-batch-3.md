We used a homemade ham stock that we had in the freezer made from the bone of a spiral ham. I cooked the onion and garlic and chicken together in the olive oil, then added that and the rest of the ingredients to my crock-pot, following the directions at the end for adding the sour cream and whipping cream when the crock-pot was off. You can substitute or even add many new ingredients to completely change the flavor ! Mix all ingredients except cheese and sour cream in slow cooker. Serve with dollop of sour cream.
