Teeney&#39;s American Shepherd&#39;s Pie is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions daily. Teeney&#39;s American Shepherd&#39;s Pie is something that I've loved my entire life. They're nice and they look fantastic.

Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. This American shepherds pie is a great way to celebrate St. It is made with hamburger but you could use lamb or mutton.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have teeney&#39;s american shepherd&#39;s pie using 15 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Teeney&#39;s American Shepherd&#39;s Pie::

1. Take 4 large Potatoes
1. Take 1 Onion (chopped fine)
1. Prepare 2 cup Sweet Corn
1. Make ready 2 large Carrots (peeled and chopped)
1. Make ready 1 tbsp Minced Garlic
1. Take 2 lb Ground Beef
1. Prepare 2 tbsp Flour
1. Prepare 1/2 cup Worcestershire Sauce
1. Take 2 can Green Beans
1. Take 1/2 cup Beef Broth (possibly bullion instead for a more salty alternative)
1. Prepare 4 tbsp Butter
1. Make ready 1/4 cup Half-and-Half or Milk
1. Get 2 cup Shredded Cheddar Cheese
1. Get 1 as needed Salt and Pepper
1. Take 1 Cumin, Rosemary and Thyme (optional)


In early cookery books, the dish was a means of using leftover roasted meat of any kind, and the pie dish was lined with mashed potato as well as having a mashed potato crust on top. A really good Shepherd&#39;s Pie should always start with a soffrito - that is, onion, garlic, carrots and celery sautéed on a lowish heat until sweet. It&#39;s the secret to a great flavour base that&#39;s a technique used widely by many cuisines, such as Italian cooking (for example, this Italian Shredded Beef Ragu). After this, we cook the ground / mince meat.

1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
1. Start the mashed potatoes: Peel and cut potatoes (1/2 inch or quartered). Place in pan and cover with cold water (1/2 in over potatoes). Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.
