It really tastes like the most amazing pancake breakfast, with a pool of melty butter, and warm syrup drizzled on top. Pipe each meringue in two swirls, one on top of the other, to give it the appearance of soft serve ice cream. There&#39;s not much to say about these ones except they are a bit fancy and very delicious. We took our regular Vanilla Bean French Macaron shell, popped some New Years themed sprinkles on top, then filled it with cute wee blobs of Vanilla Bean Swiss Meringue Buttercream, an Scottish baking blogger, bringing you new recipes every week and so much more.
