Most sourdough is made with white flour, but this recipe includes a mixture of rye and white flour. Rye is a lovely flour to work with and it tends to. I have made sourdough bread in the past using wheat flour. It always made a nice light tangy loaf of bread. I was just wondering if using all rye in your recipe makes a dense loaf of bread as I don&#39;t particularly like dense bread but really enjoy the taste of rye bread.
