This version of fettuccine Alfredo with broccoli is one of my favorites because it&#39;s meatless, so Meatless Monday approved, it&#39;s made with half and half rather than heavy cream, so you don&#39;t need to be rolled away from the table after eating it, and it takes almost zero time and effort to make. Meanwhile, in large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Remove chicken and garlic from skillet. While the chicken and broccoli are cooking, heat the butter and garlic in a medium sauce pan over medium-low heat. Cook until the garlic is fragrant and the butter begins to brown.
