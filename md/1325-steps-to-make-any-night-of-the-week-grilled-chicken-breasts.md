- "You should be done in a couple of minutes when the sauce becomes thick and gains viscosity."
- "Pour it on the breast pieces, stir fry some veggies and you are now a master chef at grilled meat."
- "You can make the same marinade for beef and it&#39;ll still taste great. But you have to marinate and cook it at least twice as long. Cheers! :)"
