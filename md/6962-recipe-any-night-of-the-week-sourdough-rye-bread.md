Using rye flour creates a denser texture than plain, though using all rye may be too strong for most pallets; a mixture of white flour and rye flour will give a more pleasant bread in both taste and texture. I have made sourdough bread in the past using wheat flour. It always made a nice light tangy loaf of bread. I was just wondering if using all rye in your recipe makes a dense loaf of bread as I don&#39;t particularly like dense bread but really enjoy the taste of rye bread.

Thanks, Helen To make the starter: Combine the milk, yeast, and flour. It&#39;s my first ever sourdough bread and was a bit nervous about starting off with rye flour. Rye is a lovely flour to work with and it tends to. The acids from the sourdough, combined with the properties of rye flour, make rye bread a great candidate for weekly baking. A loaf of rye stays very moist just below the crust and actually improves with age!
