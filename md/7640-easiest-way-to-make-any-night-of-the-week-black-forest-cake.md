Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream. Sift the dry cake ingredients together. Black forest cake is traditionally finished with chocolate shavings, but I took it a step further and opted for chocolate ganache. Since he loves Black Forest Cake and until now has only had the grocery store bakery version this was a special treat. The chocolate cake part is pretty basic but the Kirschwasser lifts it up and the rich buttercream is a nice contrast to the outside coating of whipped cream.
