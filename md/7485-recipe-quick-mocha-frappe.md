I have a slight, okay, fairly decently sized addiction to McDonald&#39;s Mocha Frappe&#39;s. However, as mentioned, a mocha frappe is coffee, milk, ice, chocolate, and a sweetener, blended until it&#39;s a slightly icee-like consistency. So, while the frappe is also the name for a milkshake in other countries, in the US, a frappe is a cold, chocolate coffee drink while a milkshake is an ice cream treat. Making this frozen mocha recipe helps you skip the long lines out and stay cozy at home… which is always a good thing.
