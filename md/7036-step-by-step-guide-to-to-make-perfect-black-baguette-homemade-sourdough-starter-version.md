Hey everyone, it's John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, black baguette (homemade sourdough starter version). It is one of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Black Baguette (Homemade Sourdough Starter Version) is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look wonderful. Black Baguette (Homemade Sourdough Starter Version) is something which I've loved my whole life.

Similar to my Kamut demi-baguette recipe, I utilized a short warm, and long cold, two-step bulk fermentation for this dough. When I tested cold proofing these baguettes in shape the results always yielded a slightly thicker crust compared to a warm final proof. First thing you&#39;ll notice is that this is a lower hydration recipe.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have black baguette (homemade sourdough starter version) using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

1. Prepare 4 grams Salt
1. Get 130 ml Water
1. Get 75 grams Homemade sourdough starter sponge
1. Get 30 grams Chocolate chips


It&#39;s much easier than you think it is! For many, the French-style sourdough boule (a giant round of crusty sourdough goodness) is the queen of from-scratch breads. Much like with baguettes, the less you work the dough, the better the final boule loaf will be. This recipe uses our sourdough starter recipe.

I&#39;m completely fascinated by the science of sourdough and how simple and effective it is in baking. Forgive me if this has been asked before, but I am having trouble finding out how much of a sourdough starter do you add to a bread mix. Place a baguette pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Line each well of baguette pan with thin strips of parchment paper. Starting with top edge, fold top third of dough to center, pressing to seal.
