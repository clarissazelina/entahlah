Hello everybody, it's me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, cauliflower mashed shepherd&#39;s pie. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Cauliflower mashed shepherd&#39;s pie is only one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Cauliflower mashed shepherd&#39;s pie is something that I've loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

This Mashed Cauliflower Shepherd&#39;s Pie is very filling, low-carb, gluten-free, paleo-friendly and the most important very DELICIOUS! Mashed potatoes, which normally adorn Shepherd&#39;s Pie, are high in carbs so we replaced the potatoes with cauliflower for a low-carb swap everyone will love. Still creamy and buttery, you&#39;ll barely.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have cauliflower mashed shepherd&#39;s pie using 12 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Cauliflower mashed shepherd&#39;s pie::

1. Prepare 1 lb grass fed beef
1. Take 1 head cauliflower

In this easy shepherd&#39;s pie recipe, we keep the carbs in check by using creamy mashed cauliflower in place of mashed potatoes. The ground beef filling is cooked in the same skillet used for baking the pie, making assembly (and cleanup) a breeze. This Skillet Shepherds Pie with Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes is a one pot wonder. Sauté meat and veggies in the skillet, dollop with mashed cauliflower potatoes (pre-made or homemade)… add lots of cheese (my preference) and pop the skillet in the oven to bake until golden deliciousness happens.

My usual version of shepherd&#39;s pie is just like this recipe, but with homemade mashed potatoes instead of cauliflower, and it&#39;s baked in a casserole dish. Sometimes I use homemade mashed sweet potatoes. For this version, I wanted to simplify things by using as many pre-made and pre-prepped ingredients as possible (literally the only thing you have to chop is an onion!). Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. I love shepherd&#39;s pie, but my traditional recipe is loaded with carbs!
