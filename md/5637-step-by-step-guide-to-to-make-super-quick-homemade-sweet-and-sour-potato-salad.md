For potato salad, I like to cook them in a vegetable steamer over boiling water - they absorb less water and don&#39;t get quite as mushy. Meanwhile, in a medium skillet, sauté the onions in the vegetable oil over medium heat until very soft and golden brown. Be the first to review this recipe. Usually called German Potato Salad, but many sweet-sour recipes are of Ost Friesen origin, now part of Germany, but formerly part of The Netherlands. This one is a combination of several recipes.
