You&#39;ll find chili loaded up with all kinds of untraditional ingredients, too: butternut squash, sweet potatoes, olives or mushrooms. I decided to make chili dogs at the last minute for National Hot Dog Day, I needed something fast.

I increased the chili powder and garlic powder and added a few more spices (cumin, mexican oregano, crushed red pepper, onion powder, little brown sugar, little Worchestershire sauce) for flavor. Chili recipes are as varied as any dish in America. This mild chili is a great accompaniment or can stand on its own as a meal. Simple ingredients create a smooth blend of taste and texture. Two somewhat odd ingredients play important.
