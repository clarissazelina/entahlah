The family felt balsamic vinegar was critical to the dish. It&#39;s just a simple toasted caprese sandwich but somehow the combination of the melted fresh mozzarella with the pesto, the crunchy toasted ciabatta bread and the balsamic vinegar (that I can&#39;t figure out if they put directly on the pesto sauce or if they do a balsamic reduction like I did) makes it one of the best sandwiches in Manhattan.
