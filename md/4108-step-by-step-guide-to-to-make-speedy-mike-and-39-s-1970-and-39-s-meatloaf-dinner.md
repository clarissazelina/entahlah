Consuming raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish or eggs may increase risk of foodborne illness. Meat loaf is a tough sell in any case scenario. Freeze it and serve it alongside colorless green beens and a chocolate nut brownie, though, and you&#39;ve got. The meatloaf needed a little TLC and I decided to pan sear the cubed meat and get things caramelizing. That nice, crunchy edged little nugget would be great with some cooked potatoes.
