One tip I have when canning any jam recipe is not to try and do double batches. It is VERY tempting to double jam recipes and make more. However it is difficult to make double batches of jam. Rhubarb, a reddish pink vegetable that grows in celery-like stalks and is harvested through the late summer, has a pleasing tartness, so it pairs well with sweet strawberries in a jam. Chop rhubarb into small pieces, and core and slice strawberries.
