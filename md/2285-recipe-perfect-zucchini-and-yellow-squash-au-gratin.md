For this recipe, I used tricolor fingerling potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, goat&#39;s milk, sheep&#39;s milk pecorino romano and grass-fed butter to create a version of potatoes au gratin that is loaded with flavor and nutrients. Spread half of the zucchini/squash mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat; add zucchini, yellow squash, onion, and garlic. After an afternoon of sugar and treats, I decided to put together a simple vegetable gratin, starring the enormous zucchini that we pulled out of our garden a few days ago. 

##### Instructions to make Zucchini and Yellow Squash Au Gratin:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8x8&#34; baking pan and set it aside.
1. Wash the zucchini and yellow squash, then slice them into coins about 1/4&#34; thick. Place them into a bowl and season them with 1/4 tsp each salt, pepper and oregano. Set aside.

I layered the zucchini slices, along with slices of yellow squash and tomato, and added just enough fresh basil and grated Parmesan cheese for a great herb-cheese flavor. The Neelys prepare a zucchini casserole that even veggie-haters will love.. Lightly grease/spray a casserole dish and set aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter. When butter is melted, add the squash and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender.
