recipeingredient:
-  For the fritters
- 2 cups mashed potatoes firmly packed
- 13 cup flour for the fritters
- 1 large egg
- 1223 cup grated cheese such as Cheddar Jack Mozzarella Colby Jack
- 1 large green onion chopped white parts too
-  For frying
- 2 cups oil
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all ingredients in a large mixing bowl. (Try to sprinkle the salt evenly over the entire surface area of the mashed potatoes so you don&#39;t accidentally get a super salty bite.)"
- "Get in with your hands (or a wooden spoon or spatula if you&#39;re not a handsy person) and mix everything thoroughly."
- "Preheat oil in a pan to somewhere between 350F and 375F. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you can sprinkle some flour into the oil and if it starts to gently sizzle right away, your oil&#39;s ready."
- "Gently drop batter into the oil by spoonfuls. I like to take two silverware tablespoons and make them in a quenelle shape."
- "Fry for 6 to 8 minutes until they&#39;re a dark golden brown, turning two or three times during the process to make sure all sides get cooked evenly."
- "Blot the oil from the fritters on a paper towel, paper bag, or tempura paper, and enjoy!"
