Being born in Germany this cake was always one of my favorite desserts! It is served at every special family occasion and always a hit! Although the origins of Black Forest cake are a bit fuzzy, many historians believe it originated in the Black Forest region of Germany, a large mountain range on the southwest side of the country. The area is known for producing a cherry brandy called kirschwasser (or simply kirsch), a clear, colorless spirit used in many Black Forest cake recipes.

Black forest cake, which originated in the Black Forest region of Germany, is typically made with a light chocolate sponge cake, soaked with cherry syrup and cherry brandy (Kirsch), then layered with whipped cream and cherries This version swaps the chocolate sponge for a denser, fudgier chocolate cake to delicious effect But slicing a rich chocolate cake into four thin layers can be a bit tricky Black Forest gâteau (British English) or Black Forest cake (American English) is a chocolate sponge cake with a rich cherry filling based on the German dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte (pronounced [ˈʃvaʁt͡svɛldɐ ˈkɪʁʃˌtɔʁtə]), literally &#34;Black Forest Cherry-torte&#34;. Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream. Sift the dry cake ingredients together. Black forest cake is traditionally finished with chocolate shavings, but I took it a step further and opted for chocolate ganache. Since he loves Black Forest Cake and until now has only had the grocery store bakery version this was a special treat.
