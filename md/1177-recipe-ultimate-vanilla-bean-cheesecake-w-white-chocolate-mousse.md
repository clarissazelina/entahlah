recipeingredient:
-  Crust
- 1 12 cup Graham crackers finely crushed
- 14 cup granulated sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 14 tsp vanilla extract
- 6 tbsp butter melted
-  cheesecake
- 16 oz cream cheese softened
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 12 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 vanilla bean seeds inside
-  White chocolate mousse
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 13 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tbsp powdered sugar
- 4 oz cream cheese
- 6 oz white chocolate baking squares
-  Sweet whipped cream optional
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 12 tbsp powdered sugar
- 1 Vanilla bean seeds from inside
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat the oven to 375°F. Combine all ingredients under the crust section in a medium bowl."
- "Transfer mix to a 9 inch spring form pan. You can use a bigger on if you want or all you have, but your layers will be thinner. Bake in the oven for 7 or 8 minutes and then remove it an allow it to cool."
- "Reduce oven to 350°F."
- "In a medium bowl or if you have a kitchen-aid beat the cream cheese until it&#39;s soft and creamy. Then add in all other ingredients from the cheesecake section but the vanilla bean. Once everything is mixed good add in the vanilla bean seeds and mix until they are evenly spread out. Careful not to over mix."
- "Spread cheesecake mix over fully cooled crust and place in the over. Cook for about 33 to 35 minutes. You want the outer edge to be set and the middle will jiggle a little bit. Once done remove from the oven and allow it to cool completely. (I threw mine in the fridge after about 10 or 15 minutes to speed things up) You can work on the next steps no need to wait."
- "For the mousse, mix cream and vanilla in a bowl and beat with electric mixer until soft peaks form. (google if you need too ?) add the powdered sugar and beat more until peaks are just a bit stiffer. Melt down your chocolate, but do it slowly it&#39;s a pain and will burn easily. In a separate bowl mix cream cheese until soft then add in your melted chocolate."
- "Once mixed well you want to add it to your other bowl. Don&#39;t use a mixer you want to fold it in so you do not deflate the cream. Now just throw it in the fridge until your cake is cooled."
- "Finally the last part and this is optional. In a bowl mix cream and sugar until soft peaks form again. Add in vanilla bean seeds and continue to beat until slightly stiffer and seeds are evenly mixed."
- "All you gotta do now is put it together. Scoop in your mousse and spread over your cheesecake and then scoop whipped cream on top of that and spread it over the mousse. Put it in the fridge for 2 or more hours before you serve it."
