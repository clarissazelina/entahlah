We love meatloaf and I&#39;ve made many meatloaves over the years, some better than others. This recipe is the one I make most of the time now. I use Italian bread crumbs which add flavor but don&#39;t draw all of the moisture from the meat and bake them on a broiler pan so the grease will drain, and the whole loaf gets a beautiful crust. When it&#39;s comfort that you seek, nothing satisfies quite like a classic meatloaf.
