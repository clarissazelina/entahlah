Another gold star libation (and one noted as a recommendation from &#39;the Liquid Chef&#39;) was a Sandia Mojito; translated a &#39;Watermelon Mojito&#39;. This I enjoyed late evening along the side of the winding azure-tiled serpentine pool where it meets the sea watching the most extraordinary sunset I may have ever seen. They kept their rum in the cooler, so the drink didn&#39;t get watered down as soon as the alcohol was poured into the glass. My version has fresh watermelon juice, for a fun tropical twist. It&#39;s not as fizzy, but it&#39;s sweet without the need for any processed sugar.
