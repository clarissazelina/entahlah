Most pasta dishes with Tropea onions are made with pasta tubes such as rigatoni or macaroni (Italian write it &#39;maccheroni&#39;),although spaghetti is popular too. I used elicoidali which are similar to rigatoni. Like rigatoni, this pasta is a tube shape but the ridges are curved around the tube rather than straight and the pasta is slightly. Tropea is our go-to date night spot on the Eastside, as well as great place to bring out of town guests due to the extensive menu options (particularly the pasta!). Great, friendly service, options to sit inside or outside and authentic, southern Italian cuisine make this our fave Italian restaurant on the Eastside.
