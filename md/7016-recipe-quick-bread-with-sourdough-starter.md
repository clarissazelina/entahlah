- 1 part warm water
- 3 parts flour more or less
-  salt 1 tsp per 500 g flour
-  honey 1 tsp per 500 g flour
-  sourdough starter
-  whatever you like for flavor eg anise cloves grated cheese olives etc optionally
recipeinstructions:
- "Using a large bowl, dissolve the sourdough starter in the warm water (it shouldn&#39;t be very hot)."
- "Add most of the flour, the salt and whatever spice you have chosen (if you like). Knead well and add as much flour as is necessary to make a dough that doesn&#39;t stick to your hands. Take care to not add too much flour because the bread will be very firm."
- "Knead for an additional 10&#39;-15&#39; minutes."
- "Set aside a piece of the dough to use as a starter for the next time you make bread. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and leave in a warm place (during winter, next to the fireplace or a slightly preheated oven, but make sure that it is not on) for 8-12 hours until it doubles in size."
- "Shape your dough into loaves and place in respective trays which you have brushed lightly with oil. Score the top with a knife and brush with a little water (at this point you can sprinkle with sesame seeds and press them a bit with your hand). Set them aside to rise once more."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 200°C, for about 40&#39; (depending on the oven and the size of the bread)."
