However, this recipe is our favorite and hope that you give it a try. Made this yesterday and it turned out great! I fried the onion before adding it to the mixture because I don&#39;t like the crunchy raw onion texture. For the meatloaf: Mix together the chuck, breadcrumbs, tomato sauce, sea salt, some pepper, egg, onions and potatoes in a large bowl. Form the beef mixture into a bread-like loaf and place in the center of the baking pan.
