recipeingredient:
- 1 14 lbs lean ground pork
- 1 medium onion thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 12 cup rice wine vinegar
- 4 tbsp fish sauce
- 4 tbsp packed brown sugar
- 1 Thai chilli finely sliced optional
- 27 oz packages precooked udon noodles
- 2 large stalks of kale leaves stripped and chopped
- 1 medium carrot finely grated
- 2 stalks celery finely chopped
recipeinstructions:
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Crumble the pork into the pan and then don&#39;t touch it for 5 minutes. Seriously, you want to leave it alone so the meat can caramelize and start forming a crust. When the 5 minutes are up, use a wooden spoon to break the meat up further."
- "After an additional 5 minutes the pork should be pretty much cooked. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and turn down the heat to medium. Give the meat a stir every so often as you prep the sauce and noodles."
- "In a bowl, whisk together.the vinegar, fish sauce, sugar and chilli. Fill a medium pot with water and put it on high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and drop in the udon."
- "Once the udon noodles break apart (about 2 minutes) drain and add them to the pan of meat along with the kale. Let cook 1 minute, just until the kale softens a bit. Stir in the carrot and celery."
- "Pour the sauce into the pan and toss everything together. It&#39;ll seem overly wet at first, but the noodles will drink up most of the sauce, which will also thicken into almost a glaze. Serve hot."
