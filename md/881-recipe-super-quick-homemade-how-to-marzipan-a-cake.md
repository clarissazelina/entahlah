recipeingredient:
- 1 lb marzipan
-  For the glaze
- 6 ozs apricot jam warmed with 23 tablespoons water then sieved
recipeinstructions:
- "Place almost half of the marzipan on a surface dredged with icing sugar, or between two sheets of parchment paper. Roll out evenly until a little larger than the top of the cake and cut out a round about 1/2 inch larger than the top of the cake. Set aside."
- "Roll out the remaining marzipan, including the trimmings, to a strip. Cut two lengths of string, one the circumference of the cake the other the exact height of the cake. Using the string as a guide, cut the maripan into strips the same width and circumference as the cake."
- "Stand the cake on a cake board. Brush the sides of the cake with the apricot glaze and fit the strips of marzipan around the cake. Press the ends together with a round-bladed knife"
- "Brush the top of the cake with the apricot glaze and position the circle of marzipan on top. Press the edges together with the round-bladed knife. If the marzipan is too moist, rub lightly all over with sifted icing sugar."
- "Store the cake, uncovered, in a warmish place for at least 24 hours, and preferably a little longer, until dry. If the marzipan is still wet when the icing is added the oils will seep into the icing and make unattractive stains."

You could certainly use fondant as a substitute, since it has the same sweet flavor and a moldable consistency, but you&#39;ll find it&#39;s not as easy to work with. The almonds in marzipan act as a flour, keeping the product moist and easy to roll. How do you apply marzipan to a cake?
