Steak purist as he is, hubs preferred his steak without this marinade and didn&#39;t use it. In hindsight I wish I would have followed suit. Thank goodness l at least used fresh garlic, but I think both the lemon juice and hefty amount of garlic powder contributed a strong, &#34;off flavor,&#34; as one reviewer put it, that I just didn&#39;t care for - not so sure I liked the basil either. It&#39;s truly the BEST easy balsamic steak marinade recipe out there. This amazing, easy steak marinade works well for just about any cut of meat, but I especially love it on sirloin steaks.
