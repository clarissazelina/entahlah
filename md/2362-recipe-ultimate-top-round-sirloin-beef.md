Beef loin, shell steak and strip steak. Beef top sirloin steak is sliced across the grain for tenderness, coated in a sweet-and-savory soy sauce marinade, then quickly stir fried with fresh green pepper, onion, and tomatoes.. Sliced top round steak is browned and simmered with vinegar, brown-gravy mix, and spices. The Top Round is the largest muscle in the round, and gristle-free when trimmed correctly. We use Top Rounds in our deli to make our amazing roast beef for slicing.
