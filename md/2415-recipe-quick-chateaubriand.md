Chateaubriand (sometimes called chateaubriand steak) is a dish that traditionally consists of a large center cut fillet of tenderloin grilled between two lesser pieces of meat that are discarded after cooking. While the term originally referred to the preparation of the dish, Auguste Escoffier named the specific center cut of the tenderloin the Chateaubriand. Chateaubriand is beef tenderloin cooked between two thin steaks which are then tossed for a tasty dish. Châteaubriand, the classic steak for two made from a center-cut filet, requires little dressing up.

Like most high-quality cuts, it&#39;s best cooked rare to medium. Today, a chateaubriand is generally agreed-upon to be a large center cut filet mignon, roasted and served alongside potatoes and a sauce (appropriately named chateaubriand sauce) usually made with shallots, beef or veal stock, white wine, tarragon, and butter. This chateaubriand preparation uses an approximately four-inch section of beef tenderloin, which is the most tender cut of beef. Because it&#39;s so thick, the chateaubriand must be roasted carefully to ensure it is properly cooked, hence the technique described above. Descended from an old aristocratic family from Brittany, Chateaubriand was a royalist by political disposition.
