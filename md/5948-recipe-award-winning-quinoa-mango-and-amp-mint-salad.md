This post was created in partnership with the National Mango Board. To chop a mango: Cut mango in half lengthwise, slicing around the pit. Note: Quinoa, a delicately flavored grain, was a staple in the ancient Incas&#39; diet. Toasting it before cooking enhances its flavor, and rinsing removes any residue of saponin, quinoa&#39;s natural, bitter protective covering. Slice both ends off the mango, revealing the long, slender seed inside.
