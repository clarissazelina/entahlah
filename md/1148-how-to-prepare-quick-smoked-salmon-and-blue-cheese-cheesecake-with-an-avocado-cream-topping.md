Sumptuous portions of smoked salmon &amp;whitefish, freshly sliced tomatoes, onions and cucumbers, Greek olives. The only thing I changed from the original recipe is i didn&#39;t use any mayo, only cream cheese with garlic and dill, i like better that way. Everyone loved them, you should give them a try. Gently mix together the cheese, chives and avocado with the lemon juice and plenty of seasoning. Spoon into the salmon-lined ramekins, press down, fold over the overlapping salmon, then cling film to seal in the mixture.
