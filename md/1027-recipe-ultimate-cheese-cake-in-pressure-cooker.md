An almost perfect pressure cooker cheesecake should look and taste great. Relatively smooth surface and side with minimal air bubbles. My cheesecake emerged from the pressure cooker with zero cracks and only a few pockmarks from where water dripped back onto the surface from the lid. The water was quickly dabbed away with a paper towel, and then a thin coating of sour cream covered up the remaining blemishes. Connie, a Pressure Cooking Today reader, asked if I could change my oven-baked Peanut Butter Cheesecake Chocolate Cake into a pressure cooker cheesecake recipe.
