- 1 part warm water
- 3 parts flour more or less
-  salt 1 tsp per 500 g flour
-  honey 1 tsp per 500 g flour
-  sourdough starter
-  whatever you like for flavor eg anise cloves grated cheese olives etc optionally
recipeinstructions:
- "Using a large bowl, dissolve the sourdough starter in the warm water (it shouldn&#39;t be very hot)."
- "Add most of the flour, the salt and whatever spice you have chosen (if you like). Knead well and add as much flour as is necessary to make a dough that doesn&#39;t stick to your hands. Take care to not add too much flour because the bread will be very firm."
- "Knead for an additional 10&#39;-15&#39; minutes."
- "Set aside a piece of the dough to use as a starter for the next time you make bread. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and leave in a warm place (during winter, next to the fireplace or a slightly preheated oven, but make sure that it is not on) for 8-12 hours until it doubles in size."
- "Shape your dough into loaves and place in respective trays which you have brushed lightly with oil. Score the top with a knife and brush with a little water (at this point you can sprinkle with sesame seeds and press them a bit with your hand). Set them aside to rise once more."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 200°C, for about 40&#39; (depending on the oven and the size of the bread)."

Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, bread with sourdough starter. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Angelic Bakehouse makes the best tasting sprouted whole grain bread. Our facility and products are free of milk, eggs, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, &amp; sesame. Whether it conjures up a crusty, flavorful loaf of bread or a bubbling crock of flour/water starter, sourdough is a treasured part of many bakers&#39; kitchens.

Bread with sourdough starter is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They're nice and they look wonderful. Bread with sourdough starter is something which I've loved my whole life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have bread with sourdough starter using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Bread with sourdough starter::

1. Prepare 1 part warm water
1. Get 3 parts flour (more or less)
1. Prepare  salt (1 tsp per 500 g flour)
1. Make ready  honey (1 tsp per 500 g flour)
1. Make ready  sourdough starter
1. Prepare  whatever you like for flavor (e.g. anise, cloves, grated cheese, olives, etc.) optionally


Be sure that you clean the jar well before putting the saved starter. Or you can stash your starter in the fridge once it&#39;s established and bake from it once a week. Making sourdough bread with a starter will take longer to rise when compared to using a commercial yeast, but the results are well worth it. Plus you can use that sourdough starter discard to create more delicious recipes. 

##### Steps to make Bread with sourdough starter:

1. Using a large bowl, dissolve the sourdough starter in the warm water (it shouldn&#39;t be very hot).
1. Add most of the flour, the salt and whatever spice you have chosen (if you like). Knead well and add as much flour as is necessary to make a dough that doesn&#39;t stick to your hands. Take care to not add too much flour because the bread will be very firm.
1. Knead for an additional 10&#39;-15&#39; minutes.
1. Set aside a piece of the dough to use as a starter for the next time you make bread. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and leave in a warm place (during winter, next to the fireplace or a slightly preheated oven, but make sure that it is not on) for 8-12 hours until it doubles in size.
1. Shape your dough into loaves and place in respective trays which you have brushed lightly with oil. Score the top with a knife and brush with a little water (at this point you can sprinkle with sesame seeds and press them a bit with your hand). Set them aside to rise once more.

Second, think about your timeline for baking bread. If you want to use the sourdough starter soon, the best practice is to keep it on your kitchen counter, or whatever room-temperature area is. This was my first successful sourdough starter! Each day you &#34;feed&#34; the starter with equal amounts of fresh flour and water. As the wild yeast grows stronger, the starter will become more frothy and sour-smelling.
