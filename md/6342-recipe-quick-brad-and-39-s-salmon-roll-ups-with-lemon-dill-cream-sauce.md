- "Place pieces of meat on a board with the long side towards you. Spread crab mixture evenly on top. Roll up to the short side. You should have a long tube about 3 inches around. Using butchers twine, tie around the roll, starting at an inch from the end. Tie every two inches. Repeat this until all of the salmon is rolled and tied."
