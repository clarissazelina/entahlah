Slice the sausage and prepare the veggies. The combination of sausage and shrimp (and all those veggies) works so well in this recipe - but what I particularly love about this recipe is that it is SO easy to prepare and cook. And the great thing about using Founder&#39;s Select Pre-Cooked Polish Sausage (other than the flavor!) for this recipe is that it is ideal for this one pan dish as. Sheet pan dinners are a life savor when it comes to quick and healthy weeknight dinners! This combo of shrimp, sausage and asparagus seasoned with Old Bay seasoning is served with lemony aioli, yum!
