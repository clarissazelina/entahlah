- 12 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- 34 cup sugar for dusting

recipeinstructions:
- "Traditionally you need a piping bag and a large star tip to make these, however u can hand roll them. BUT the texture is not the same. I highly recommend you use the piping bag."
- "Place water, butter, salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a medium saucepan and let it come to a boil over medium high heat."
- "Once the water begins to boil add the flour ALL AT ONCE, and begin to stir vigorously with a WOODEN SPOON. The dough should come together quickly and form a ball. There should be NO white lumps of flour it should be smooth. Once dough is formed, continue to cook, stiring continously for 1 MINUTE. Remove from heat."
- "Preheat oil in a deep large skillet or large pot to 360° or medium/ med high heat.  Should be about 2 inches deep."
- "Add egg and vanilla to the dough and beging to mix. Dough should have cooled a bit as you placed your oil to preheat. The dough will appear to crumble apart with the addition of the egg, but with continued mixing it will come back together into a a soft shiny dough. DON&#39;T GIVE UP."
- "As soon as ur dough is formed place it in your piping bag, or form with hands (Again the piping bag is better!)"
- "A lot of people squeeze the churros directly into the oil to the desired length and cut off with kitchen shears. You will get churros in all shapes and sizes as pictured above. However if you are a fan of straight churros then the best way to achieve this is to prepipe your churros onto a piece of parchment paper, then fry, keeping in mind the size of your skillet or pot, as they expand."
- "Fry your churros until golden brown, and place on paper towels to drain excess oil. The outside will be crunchy and the inside soft and light."
- "Mix 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon together, and roll or dust churros with the mixture. Dusting allows for more control of the sweetness."
- "Traditionally in Mexico churros are enjoyed with a chocolate sauce for dipping or Hot chocolate for sipping. However I find a nice cup of coffee or glass of milk are just as good."
