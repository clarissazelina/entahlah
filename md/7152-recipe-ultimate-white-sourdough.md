Hello everybody, it is Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, white sourdough. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

White Sourdough is only one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. White Sourdough is something that I have loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

The additional motive for this post was that I will be hosting a Sourdough Toast Morning for this year&#39;s Sourdough September event organised by the Real Bread Campaign in the UK. Friends will be invited for a Sunday morning filled with sourdough goodness, homemade jams, fresh avocados as well as cinnamon toast. Before we delve into process, let&#39;s cover some basics.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have white sourdough using 4 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make White Sourdough::

1. Make ready 400 grams very strong white flour
1. Take 200 grams white sourdough starter (100% hydration)
1. Get 10 grams salt
1. Prepare 275 ml water


The dough cycle of the bread machine can be used to prepare the dough, if you like. Prep time does not include proofing time for starter. Perfect with smashed avo &amp; poached eggs. Vegan vg; Vegetarian v; Dairy-free df &#34;This recipe uses a levain (a dedicated quantity of well-fed starter). 

##### Instructions to make White Sourdough:

1. Mix ingredients together adding water last and keeping salt away from starter until water added
1. Bring together into a dough and knead well for 10-15 mins until smooth
1. Leave dough, covered at room temperature for 4-6 hours.
1. Shape - using as little flour as possible- use oil if needed and a scraper
1. Leave to prove, covered, in a proving basket for another 3-4 hours
1. Sprinkle base with flour and turn out onto a baking surface - eg stone or pizza tray - heavily dusted with flour or semolina
1. Bake at 210C for 25 mins and 200 for a further 15
1. Turn oven off and leave bread on for a further 10 mins


A disposable plastic shower cap is also a handy piece of kit, brilliant for covering bowls of dough or proving. Sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. Broadly speaking, the yeast produces gas (carbon dioxide) which leavens the dough, and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor in the form of sourness. The lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast cannot, while the yeast metabolizes the byproducts of lactic. Instructions: In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients into a stiff batter and beat a few minutes with a wooden spoon or in a stand mixer.
