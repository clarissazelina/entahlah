recipeinstructions:
- "(One egg per potato) Crack the eggs into a medium-sized bowl. Add in pepper and salt and whip with fork. Have it be saltier than desired as the potatoes will absorb some salt."
- "Grate or pulverize the onion into the egg mixture. (Pictured is the grater I use.)"
- "Peel and grate the potatoes into the eggs - this helps prevent the potatoes from browning."
- "Heat up a skillet or frying pan with olive oil or an oil of your choice. Scoop out some latkeh mixture and shape it more on the thin side for a crunchiness. Be careful with making it too thick\heavy. It will be harder to flip over and is more likely to crumble."

Hello everybody, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, potato latkes. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Potato Latkes is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Potato Latkes is something which I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

More like a potato pancake, instead of a true latkes, but that&#39;s just my personal preference. Coarsely grate potatoes and onion; drain any liquid. Place in a bowl; add green onions, egg, salt and pepper.


To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook potato latkes using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Potato Latkes::

1. Make ready 5 Eggs
1. Make ready 5 Potatoes
1. Take 1 yellow onion
1. Take  Pepper
1. Prepare  Salt
1. Get  Peeler
1. Make ready  Grater


This is my mother&#39;s recipe, which is honestly the best latke I&#39;ve had. I usually end up having to make a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I&#39;ve tried other recipes and always return to these. Latkes, which are wonderfully crisp potato pancakes, are the specialty of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah. 

##### Instructions to make Potato Latkes:

1. (One egg per potato) Crack the eggs into a medium-sized bowl. Add in pepper and salt and whip with fork. Have it be saltier than desired as the potatoes will absorb some salt.
1. Grate or pulverize the onion into the egg mixture. (Pictured is the grater I use.)
1. Peel and grate the potatoes into the eggs - this helps prevent the potatoes from browning.
1. Heat up a skillet or frying pan with olive oil or an oil of your choice. Scoop out some latkeh mixture and shape it more on the thin side for a crunchiness. Be careful with making it too thick\heavy. It will be harder to flip over and is more likely to crumble.
1. Keep experimenting to get your desired texture :) We made it a bit too thick this time around- so it tasted like delicious potato kugel!


But it&#39;s actually the oil, not the potatoes, that is significant for the holiday. As the tale goes, ancient Jews used the small amount of oil they had to rededicate their Temple in Jerusalem and the oil lasted for eight days, which is why. For the latkes, finely grate the potatoes and onion and mix together. Place the grated potato and onion into a colander and squeeze out as much moisture as you can. Or roll up the potato and onion in a clean kitchen tea towel and wring well to extract the liquid.
