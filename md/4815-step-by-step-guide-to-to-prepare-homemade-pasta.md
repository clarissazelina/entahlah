Bean pasta incorporates beans and legumes, such as lentils, black beans and chickpeas, into the pasta dough itself, creating a highly nutritious substitute for classic wheat. There are many different varieties of pasta. They are usually sorted by size, being long (pasta lunga), short (pasta corta), stuffed (ripiena), cooked in broth (pastina), stretched (strascinati) or in dumpling-like form (gnocchi/gnocchetti). Yet, due to the variety of shapes and regional variants, &#34;one man&#39;s gnocchetto can be another&#39;s strascinato&#34;..

Pasta carbonara is traditionally made with raw egg yolks and whipping cream. This lighter version achieves the same texture with egg substitute and fat-free evaporated milk. Egg substitutes are excellent to use in recipes that traditionally call for raw eggs. Substitutes are pasteurized and have a low risk of containing bacteria. Pasta, eggs, cheese, and bacon come together in the ultimate Italian favorite: spaghetti carbonara.
