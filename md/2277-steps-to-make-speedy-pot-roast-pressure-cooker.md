recipeingredient:
- 34 lb beef chuck
- 2 Tbsp salt
- 1 Tbsp oil
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 cloves garlic sliced
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 12 cup vermouth
- 1 cup red wine
- 1 Bou beef bouillon cube
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 12 oz frozen pearl onions
- 1 lb potatoes cubed
- 5 medium carrots cut in pieces
- 10 oz mushrooms quartered
- 3 Tbsp corn starch
- 2 Tbsp fresh parsley chopped
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the ingredients. Combine the water, wine, boullion, Worcestershire, and fish sauce. In a bowl layer the mushrooms, carrots and potatoes. This is so when the vegetables go in, the potatoes will be in the liquid and the mushrooms on top."
- "In the pressure cooker, add 1 Tbsp oil and heat on high. Add the onions and cook until browning, or they release their liquid. (If you&#39;re using a dutch oven, brown the meat first [steps 5-7] in the dutch oven on the stovetop, remove and then follow these directions)."
- "Add the garlic, tomato paste, and spices."
- "When the paste begins to stick to the bottom, add the liquid."
- "Season the beef chuck with salt."
- "Sear the chuck in a skillet on high heat with a little oil."
- "Degaze the pan with the vermouth and add it to the pressure cooker."
- "Add the chuck to the pressure cooker."
- "Cook on high pressure for 35 min followed by immediate pressure release. If using a dutch oven, cook covered in a 300°F oven for 2-3 hours adding more water as necessary."
- "Add the veggies so the potatoes are on the bottom and mostly submerged, then the carrots, followed by the mushrooms. Cook on high pressure 15 minutes followed by natural pressure relief. If using the dutch oven, cook with the cover ajar 40-50 min more or until the potatoes are tender."
- "Combine the starch with 1/4 cup of water."
- "Remove the pot roast from the pot and set aside."
- "Bring the liquid in the pot to a simmer and add the starch slurry, stirring to thicken."
- "Slice the pot roast, return it to the thickened sauce to reheat."
- "Sprinkle the parsley on and serve in large bowls. I like to add simple steamed green peas as a side."

Pot roast is one of the comfort foods that reminds me of the wonderful Sunday dinners mom cooked when I was growing up. It&#39;s a meal I love to serve my family and making it in the pressure cooker gets me out of the kitchen in less than half the time. With an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, the classic Sunday afternoon pot roast can be on the table in under two hours -- without ever turning on your oven. We seasoned this one with North African ingredients -- dates, olives, and oranges -- but remained loyal to the traditional American chuck roast, which, like other inexpensive cuts, braises well.

Pack it on every inch of the roast. The most important step in preparation is the searing. I&#39;m grateful for the browning preset on pressure cookers. If we were using a slow cooker, we&#39;d have to sear the roast on the stove. Sear the roast in hot oil on ALL sides!
