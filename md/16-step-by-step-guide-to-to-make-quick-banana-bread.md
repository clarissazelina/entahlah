recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180°C (upper and lower heat). Grease the cake tin."

This will prevent the top of the cake to get too dark. Remove the foil towards the end of the baking time."
- "Let the cake cool off completely in the cake tin. Then turn out the cake onto a cake platter."
