Brown flour in a non stick skillet over medium heat. After flour is brown, set aside. In another pot, melt butter and saute onion, green onion, garlic, celery, parsley until done. A shrimp stew so to speak. And lucky for me, I happened upon an inspiration from the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, and particularly Gaza… A flavor-packed shrimp stew in chunky tomato sauce with bell peppers and warm Eastern Mediterranean spices.
