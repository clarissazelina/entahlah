recipeingredient:
-  Rye Sourdough
- 255 g whole grain rye flour
- 255 g warm water
- 25 g rye sourdough starter
- 25 g salt
-  Main Dough
- 370 g whole grain rye flour
- 11 g salt
- 20 g molasses or honey
- 260 g warm water
-  Optional mixins
- 100 g toasted sunflower seeds flaxseeds dried fruits etc or mix
recipeinstructions:
- "(Day 1) Mix all ingredients for rye sourdough. Cover well and let ferment for 20-24 hours at room temperature. It should become frothy and bubbly."
- "(Day 2) In a large bowl, measure out the rye flour, salt and molasses/honey for the main dough. Place rye sourdough from day 1 on top and pour over warm water. Mix with your hands or a sturdy wet spatula for about 5 minutes. It&#39;s VERY sticky and more like a &#34;paste&#34; than a dough - you won&#39;t be able to knead."
- "When well mixed, add any mix-ins and incorporate evenly into the dough by mixing an additional 2 minutes or so."
- "My dough looked like this after everything is finished."
- "Grease a bread loaf pan with butter or oil and dust with flour. Another option is to line with parchment paper."
- "Put in the dough and gently press into the loaf pan. Even out the top with a scraper or your hands."
- "Dust top with flour (I used fine ground rye flour)."
- "Let rise at room temperature (24째C/75째F) for 2 hours (it&#39;s okay if the temperature is not exactly that). It should rise up to the top of the loaf pan."
- "While dough is rising, preheat oven to 250C/480F. Put a steam pan at the bottom rack of the oven when preheating for throwing in some boiling water for steam later. Prepare a kettle of boiling water as well."
- "After the dough had risen, make a crisscross pattern on the top by gently pressing down with the edge of a pastry card or something similar. (about 5 mm or 1/4 inch or so deep)."
- "Total baking time is 70 minutes.... Bake at 250C/480F for 10 minutes with steam. Then remove/release steam and turn temperature down to 200C/400F and bake for another 30 minutes. Remove the bread from its tin and put back in the oven for a final 30 minutes. Removing the bread from the pan lets the sides brown up into a nicer color."
- "Let cool completely before slicing (its still cooking when you pull it out of the oven!), preferably waiting until the next day to let the flavors develop."
