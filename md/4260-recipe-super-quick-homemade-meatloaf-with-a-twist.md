- "Sauté the vegetables over medium heat in a large sauté pan in a tablespoon of olive oil until soft."
- "In a large mixing bowl combine the sautéed vegetables, bread crumbs, milk, salt, pepper, and eggs. Let this mixture sit for about minute to allow the bread crumbs soak up the milk."
- "Add the ground beef to the mixing bowl. Use your hands to completely mix all the ingredients together. Your hands will get very messy, use gloves if desired."
- "Place the mixture in the refrigerator for about a half hour to let it set."
