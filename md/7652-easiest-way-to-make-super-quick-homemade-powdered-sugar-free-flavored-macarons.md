-  To make an easy chocolate ganache
- 40 grams Chocolate the same amount if youre using strawberryflavored or white chocolate
- 20 grams Vegetablebased nondairy whipped cream
- 6 grams Your desired flavors such as matcha tea powder dried strawberry powder or instant coffee
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the ☆ powders with the almond flour. Finely grind up the freeze dried strawberries or black tea leaves (using a food processor or a mortar and pestle)."
- "Sift the almond flour. (It&#39;s easier to sift if you put it in the freezer about 15 minutes before sifting, and sift just before using it.)"
- "Put the egg whites and sugar in a bowl, and beat over a hot water bath that&#39;s about 70 °C. When the hot water is about 70°C, it should just have fine bubbles around the bottom and sides of the pan."
- "Beat the egg whites and sugar very well, until it&#39;s stiff enough that it clings to the bowl when inverted."
- "The meringue should be snowy white, very finely textured, shiny, and a little sticky. (It will also be warm.)"
- "Take the bowl of meringue off the hot water bath. Sift the almond powder from Step 1 again as you add it to the meringue. (The almond powder should be sifted 2 times in total.)"
- "Mix the ★ ingredient(s) of your choice into the bowl."
- "Fold the meringue and almond flour together, then mix well until the batter forms a thick, heavy ribbon when dropped from the spatula."
- "If you want to dry the macarons out, go to Step 10. If you want to skip the drying step, see&#34;Macarons with no drying needed&#34;."
- "Put the batter from Step 8 into a piping bag, and pipe it onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper in 2-3 cm circles (leave 2-3 cm between each one)."
- "To test-bake the batter, it&#39;s a good idea to cut small pieces of parchment paper to bake on. (Use to test how much to dry the batter and to adjust the oven temperature.)"
- "Leave the piped out batter it has completely dried on the surface. (It should not stick to your fingers when you touch them, and they should feel rubbery.)"
- "On a warm day with low humidity, the macarons will dry out in about 30 minutes. They will take some time on a cold day. It&#39;s most difficult to dry them out on humid days."
- "Preheat the oven to 160°C, and bake the dried batter from Step 12. Lower the oven temperature to 130°C, and bake for 15 to 16 minutes. (Adjust the time and temperature depending on your oven.)"
- "Try doing a test-bake of the dried macaron batter using the small pieces of paper from Step 11. If the test macarons turn out, you can bake the rest."
- "Let the baked macarons cool down completely before peeling them off the parchment paper. If it&#39;s hard to peel them off, put them in the freezer on the paper for a few minutes, and they should come off easily."
- "They are baked just right when they stick to the paper and can&#39;t be peeled off easily. If they come off easily, it is likely that they are a bit overbaked, and may be hollow in the middle."
- "Sandwich two macarons with a cream filling of your choice in between, and the macarons are done. They are tastiest from the following day onwards after they have become moist."
- "Macarons that are baked just right do not have hollow centers, and give a moist and airy sensation. (The one in the photo is a black tea flavored macaron filled with berry paste.)"
- "Store the macarons in the refrigerator, and consume them within a week. You can also wrap them individually and freeze them. (Defrost them in the refrigerator.)"
- "For details on the reasons why things can go wrong, see&#34;Helpful Hints for Foolproof Macarons&#34;."
- "To make chocolate ganache, put chocolate and whipped cream in a piping bag, and suspend it over 60°C warm water to melt the chocolate. Squeeze the bag to mix."
- "To make matcha tea- or coffee-flavored ganache, use white chocolate and melt it before adding the powder. Squeeze the piping bag well to mix."
- "When it has been chilled and has stiffened to the right consistency, the ganache is done. If you add instant coffee to the (brown) chocolate, you&#39;ll have a café-mocha flavored ganache."
- "From left to right: matcha, black tea, coffee, mlik, cocoa, and strawberry (I crushed some freeze dried strawberries into a powder and mixed it in)."
- "I have another recipe for more flavored macaron varieties like kabocha squash , azuki beans, purple sweet potatoes, almonds, kinako, pistachios."
- "Try using strawberry powder for pretty pink macarons, cherry blossom shaped macarons)."
- "I decorated these macarons with chocolate (dark, white, matcha tea flavored, coffee flavored)."
- "Macarons sandwiched with homemade guimauves like French marshmallowsare elegant, too."
- "For easy marbled macarons: Prepare the plain macaron batter up to the step before the macaronage. Divide the batter in half inside the bowl."
- "Mix flavorings into one half of the plain macaron batter. Fold the two batters together, and it will easily turn into a marbled pattern."
- "Freeze the leftover egg yolks with 5 g of sugar  mixed in per yolk. This way, the texture of the yolk will not deteriorate when frozen. Defrost the yolks in the refrigerator before use."
