Leftover challah also makes excellent French toast, bread pudding, bostock…basically, I&#39;m. Challah is a special Jewish bread that is traditionally eaten on Shabbat and Yamim Tovim (Jewish Holidays). Challah is one of my favorite traditional breads. A braided loaf of eggy white bread, sometimes topped with sesame or poppy seeds, as a result, it makes an appearance at most special meals. Sourdough challah seemed liked a good choice, but I wasn&#39;t sure where to start, so it sort of drifted to the back of my mind.
