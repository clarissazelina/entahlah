Your sloppy joe isn&#39;t so sloppy anymore. Instead of piling the saucy meat onto hamburger buns, stuff a classic sloppy joe mix into rounds of prepared biscuit dough. The sloppy joe flavor didn&#39;t mesh at all with the biscuit flavor. We wound up opening up the pockets and spooning out the meat filling to put on hotdog buns.

But even if it&#39;d tasted all right they probably would not have been worth the effort of rolling the dough filling closing and cooking the extra fifteen minutes in the oven.
