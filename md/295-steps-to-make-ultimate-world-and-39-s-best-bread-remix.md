recipeingredient:
- 420 g bread flour
- 340 mL filtered water
- 8 g salt
- 1 g dry yeast
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix yeast and salt in the warm filtered water (around 35ºC)."
- "Introduce the flour and mix well, until there is no dry bits left. A silicone spatula works well to scrape the sides of the bowl."
- "Cover (with a damp towel, or cling film) and let rise in a warm place for 12 hours. Be aware that the dough will double in volume and make sure to use a bowl big enough for it not to overflow or stick to what you used to cover it. (See for yourself in the picture!)"
- "Pour out the dough gently on a lightly floured surface. Then fold it in thirds 4 times while stretching it lightly."
- "Prepare a bowl with olive oil and flour to prevent the dough from sticking (you might need to be generous!), then move the dough to that bowl."
- "Cover the dough then leave it for another 2 to 3 hours. Expect it to rise again!"
- "Put a big enough pot (cast iron or anything thick enough to retain good heat is best) in your oven, and preheat it to 250⁰C. You want to make sure the pot is VERY HOT or the bread will stick when you bake it."
- "Once the oven is ready, take out the pot, pour the dough in (you should hear a sizzling sound if it&#39;s hot enough), put the lid back on and bake for 30 minutes at 250⁰C."
- "Take the lid off, reduce the oven temperature to 230⁰C, then bake for another 15 minutes."
- "Your bread should be ready, with a nicely colored crust. Even though it&#39;s hard to resist, make sure to let it cool down before trying to slice it open!"
- "As I only eat 1 to 2 slices a day, a loaf can last me a few days. I usually slice the whole bread once it&#39;s cooled down, wrap slices individually in plastic wrap and store them in the freezer. A few minutes in the toaster in the morning and it&#39;s as good as fresh bread!"

Best Low Carb bread; Keto dinner rolls; Keto Pretzels; Tips for recipe success: The science behind the fat head dough is the addition of mozzarella cheese or any cheese that can melt and become stretchy. Since almond flour and coconut flour do not contain gluten, the mozzarella cheese helps to fill the gap for the absence of gluten. While the colors look fun and enticing, bringing a sense of drama and modernity to your kitchen, they also serve a useful purpose too in being color-coded so that you can instantly recognize and pick the right Komachi knife for the job.

I have made changes over the years, some by suggestions of my wife. I do believe everybody smells my bread when it comes out of the oven, because here they come they all want hot bread and butter. Lauren baked up a batch of butter pecan ice cream bread in a tart pan. Turn the bread into dessert: Ice cream bread isn&#39;t overly sweet, so it makes a great breakfast or snack.
