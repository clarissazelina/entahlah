recipeinstructions:
- "Do strawberry reduction: Puree about the double the amount of required reduced strawberries or about 1 1/2 cup strawberries. Once pureed, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until it has reduced to the required 1 1/4 cup overall requirement, or until it thickens and becomes deep red in colour. Set aside and let it cool down. You may do this a day before and just let it chill on the fridge until use."

- "Make the batter. Sift and mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside."
- "Combine the all purpose cream, vinegar, and salt until lumpy. Set aside."
- "Cream together the softened butter and sugar. Beat in the egg whites to high speed. Mix in the lumpy cream mixture and add in the vanilla extract."
- "Pour in the creamy mixture slowly onto the dry ingredients and mix at low speed until well combined."
- "Pour in the milk just until combined."
- "Fold in the 1/2 cup reduced strawberry. You may add in 2 drops or less of flavor and coloring but are optional."
- "Grease and flour the pan or line the pan with aluminum foil, to avoid sticking. There are also non-sticking cooking sprays available which you may use."

You&#39;ll need a food processor or a high-powered blender to purée the strawberries. Lots of other recipes also have chopped strawberries in the batter, but I opted for thinly sliced fresh strawberries in between the cake layers for even more. In a large bowl, combine cake mix and gelatin. Add pureed strawberries, eggs, oil, and water; beat at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth.
