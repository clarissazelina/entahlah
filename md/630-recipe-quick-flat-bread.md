Well, flatbread is often compared to pita bread which naturally forms a pocket in the center while cooking, whereas naan bread is flat and more likened to a wrap or tortilla — which is usually made to go alongside Mexican cuisine. Add enough buttermilk to make a stiff dough. Some flatbreads are leavened while others do not use a raising agent. Types of flatbread include Indian chappatis and naans, Jewish matzo, Middle Eastern pitta. Using a basic ratio of five pantry staples, you can have fresh, hot bread on the table in less than an hour AND no need to turn on the oven.
