recipeingredient:
- 520 g Wholemeal Flour
- 180 g Sourdough Starter
- 3 Tbsp Olive Oil
- 150 Ml Water you might need a little more or less
- 3 Tsp Salt
- 56 Ice Cubes
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the flour and water in a large bowl to make a rough, just combined dough. Add the water bit by bit, to make sure you don&#39;t add too much and the dough gets too wet. Cover, and leave to sit for 30 minutes- 1 hour."
- "Add the sourdough starter and oil. First stir into the dough with a wooden spoon then tip out onto an oiled surface and knead for 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. You should be able to judge how wet the dough is here, and can add some more water if needs be."
- "Form the dough into a ball and place in an oiled bowl. Leave to sit in a warm spot for 4-6 hours (until doubled in size.)"
- "Tip the dough out onto a floured surface and knock it back, folding it in on itself. Add the salt. Form the dough into a ball, you do this by scooping the underside of the dough onto the top with 2 fingers. Repeat at a 45 degree angle and repeat around the dough about 3 times. Flip the dough and you should have a nice ball-shape (tucking all the folds you have made in the bottom). Make sure the counter is well-floured, so the dough doesn&#39;t stick when flipped."
- "Line a round cake-tin and place the dough onto it. Leave to proof for another 6 hours or overnight."
- "Turn on the oven to 160 Degrees. In the bottom place a baking tray with the ice (this is to create steam to soften the crust.) Bake the dough for 35-45 minutes. For the last 10 minutes remove the cake-tin."

Hey everyone, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, sourdough wholemeal loaf 🍞🐾. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

All it takes to make it look really attractive is a couple of slashes after the proofing stage. Bear in mind that different brands of wholemeal/wholewheat flour will require different amounts of water when making this loaf. Transfer to a large jar or plastic container.

As mentioned earlier, I worked with a shorter levain build for this bread. To adjust for the reduced build time we&#39;ll increase not only our inoculation of mature starter but also the water temperature. This gets the whole process moving faster, and by the time you&#39;re ready to use this levain, you&#39;ll notice some significant activity.

The perfect accompaniment to soups or lunches, just simply toasted, you won&#39;t need any special skills or effort. Wholemeal and rye no-knead sourdough loaf with Karen Martini&#39;s smashed sardines. Photo: Marcel Aucar The principle of a sourdough starter is pretty simple: a mixture of flour and water is left to allow ambient yeast and acidic bacteria to generate a stable ferment that kills off any nasty microbes and provides a natural leavening agent for baking. I recommend buying a starter (reasons for which I explain here). View this post for more Essential Sourdough Bread Baking Equipment.
