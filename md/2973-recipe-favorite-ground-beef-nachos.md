Have you got your menu all set for Super Bowl Sunday this weekend? If not, you do now. üòâüëäüèª These nachos were inspired by my teenage days when we used to frequent Taco Bell. My repeat order was beef nachos supreme. The key to these nachos is to give the beef real flavor before you add all the fixings; then everything else just becomes a bonus because the combo of spicy ground beef, melted cheese, and warm tortilla chips is already off the charts. The chipotle seasoning for our Ground Beef Tacos has superhero qualities of its own so we are using a variation of that here today.
