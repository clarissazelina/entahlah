Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, mushroom carbonara. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Mushroom carbonara is only one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look fantastic. Mushroom carbonara is something which I've loved my whole life.

Toss mushrooms and Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil once in pan to coat in oil. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. This quick mushroom carbonara pasta dish is the perfect midweek supper - speedy, scrumptious and comforting.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook mushroom carbonara using 9 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Mushroom carbonara::

1. Get 8 slices thick cut bacon, chopped into 1/2 in slivers
1. Get 1 tbsp freshly cracked black pepper (large grind)
1. Make ready 1 medium onion, chopped
1. Get 1 lb mushrooms of your choice, thinly sliced
1. Get 1 lb dry spaghetti noodles
1. Make ready 2/3 cup grated pecorino romano
1. Get 2/3 cup grated parmesan
1. Take 4 large egg yolks
1. Make ready Handful fresh Italian parsley, chopped


For this mushroom edition of the carbonara I decided to keep the bacon in. I love the saltiness it adds to otherwise quite mild tasting dish. But feel free to leave the bacon out and keep this recipe vegetarian. The process for it is very simple. 

##### Steps to make Mushroom carbonara:

1. Put a large pot of salted water on high heat.
1. Add the bacon to a large pan on high heat. Fry until the bacon is crispy but still has a little chew, about 5 minutes.
1. Add the black pepper and onions to the pan of bacon and fry 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms. Turn the heat to medium-low while you finish the noodles and sauce.
1. When the salted water reaches a boil, drop in the pasta. Keep an eye on the sauce and stir it occasionally to prevent burning.
1. When the pasta is a minute from being cooked, drag it into the pan of mushrooms. Reserve some of the pasta water.
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cheeses. Add enough cold water to thin the mixture to the consistency of runny pancake batter. Stir it quickly into the hot pasta to coat the noodles. If they still seem too thick, add a splash of pasta water. Toss in the parsley before serving.


Get the pasta going in a pot of boiling water. Stir in the spinach and stir until the leaves are just wilted. Remove from the heat and season well with salt and pepper. Beat the eggs with the cream, half the Parmesan, seasoning and nutmeg. In this easy gluten-free weeknight dish, mushrooms and pasta are cloaked in a creamy sauce made from eggs and cheese.
