Gradually add in sugar (in 3 batches), beating on high speed until frothy and stiff peaks form. you can test by lifting beaters straight up from egg whites.

- "Pour the batter into the pan. Bake for 50 - 60 minutes or until the cake is done. Check with a skewer, when it&#39;s done, the skewer will come out dry and clean."
- "When the cake is done, remove from oven then invert the pan onto table until completely cooled. This is a very important step so the cake will not sink."
- "Take the cake out of the pan and slice. Serve it as is or with whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy."
