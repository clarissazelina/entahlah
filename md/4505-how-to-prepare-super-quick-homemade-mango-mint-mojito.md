A mojito is typically made from rum, but I&#39;m a firm believer that mixing a high quality tequila with the right ingredients creates a perfect drink, so I went with it. the base of this drink is lime juice, simple syrup, fresh mint, and mango juice. A few months ago some friends and I went on a trip to Poland, and while we were there I ordered a virgin mojito at a restaurant we visited. It was a classic mojito with simple syrup, mint, lime, and sparkling water. I just wanted to drink it all night long. It&#39;s a mojito after all and the strong mint and lime flavor is what I crave most.
