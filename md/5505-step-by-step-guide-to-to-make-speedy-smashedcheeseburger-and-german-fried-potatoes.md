If you live in the American South in areas where German immigrants settled, you may have heard of it already—and if you&#39;re lucky, reveled in its comforting, crispy delights. Sometimes I peel the potatoes and sometimes I don&#39;t. I take frozen bacon because it&#39;s easier to cut and cut strips down the side to get my one inch pieces. To make German fried potatoes with bacon and onion, first you need to peel and dice your potatoes into small pieces.
