- 2 Tbsp Unsalted Butter
- 6 Cloves Garlic minced
- 1 tsp Italian Seasoning
- 8 oz Mozzarella shredded or Cubed
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.   Line a baking sheet with some aluminum foil and place the loaf of bread in the center. Making sure to cut only 2/3 of the way through the bread, cut slits on a diagonal on both sides to resemble a diamond shape (make sure you don&#39;t cut all the way through) set aside."
- "In a small saucepan, add the oil, garlic and butter and bring to a sizzle. Allow it to cook together on medium low heat for just about a minute, remove from the heat, add the Italian seasoning and set aside.(I use the microwave till the butter melts)"
- "Using a pastry brush, brush the garlic oil mixture all over the top and between each piece of bread and stuff each piece with a cubed (or shredded) mozzarella."

- "Notes- you can use any kind of bread, and cheese... my bakery didn’t have the round sourdough bread so I had to use an plain Italian loaf, and it worked out good. I used my favorite cheese, Hot jalapeño &amp; Habanero jack.hardest part was cutting it mainly because I don’t have a bread knife. (I like to use this as a snack) I didn’t measure anything, was made to taste, and what I had on hand."
