Personally, I use the organic plain Stoneyfield Greek yogurt for my starter. Stir lightly, just to incorporate the yogurt into the warm milk. Then, put the lids on the jars. Lactic acid gives yogurt its tangy taste, and also causes the proteins in the milk to thicken into a pudding-like consistency. Yogurt can be made with a number of different types of milk, but the best milk for making yogurt is a milk that you like the flavour of.
